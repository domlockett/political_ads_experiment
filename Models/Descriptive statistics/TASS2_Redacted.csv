A lot of the residents on a row home Street give themselves so much extra space that there are three less parking spots then what could actually fit there.

Americans should be able to look for leadership from the President and without that it leaves many of us to face that there is no real hope for our lives to get any better.

The management of this pandemic is another source of anger for me. That the President has been unwilling to lead by example to help control this virus has been unbelievable.   When people are so consumed by their own need to ""not be told what to do by the government"" that they can not show any compassion or consideration for others by wearing a mask is despicable.  Knowing that perhaps myself and most likely family members would not survive being sick is more than terrifying.  To be frightened every day that you or a family member may come in contact with the virus is exhausting. 


On top of all that is happening with this public health crisis, to now have to listen day in and day out that the President is refusing to concede to the President Elect is just another example to having this country run by a spoiled, self-centered child.  I see that the root of my daily anger comes from the President and his juvenile behavior and other career politicians that continue to show that they care more about keeping their jobs than doing what is right for the country.",1265,"",NA,1,6,1,2,18,5,25,5,4,NA,NA,NA,NA,2,1,1,47,3,2,1,1,43,2,1,2,5,5,9,6,2,3,8,5,1,7,4,3,4,3,3,2,3,4,2,2,15,2,2,3,5,1,4,3,3,3,2,2,6,2,3,5,1,4,2,2,4,2,4,2,3,3,3,4,4,"27",5,4,4,4,1,2,80,80,1,52,55,2,1,3,2,2,3,1,3,3,3,9,6,19,13,2,14,20,16,3,11,18,15,17,8,5,1,7,10,4,12,2,6,98,6,1,6,1,1,5,1,98,1,6,98,6,98,6,6,2,98,6,3,2,4,7,1,5,4,4,4,2,2,4,4,"Stephen Jones",8,7,1,2,3,6,9,4,5,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,2,1,2,2,1,2,2,1,1,2,1,2,1,2,1,1,4,1,2,3,2,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,3,4,3,1,1,1,8,4,"11/21/2020 0:47","11/21/2020 1:40",53,2,1,"Desktop",2,60,4,5,1,3,1,2,14,"NC",3,5,1,1,1,1,2,3,0,0,0,0,3

All it does is create echo chambers of people who all think the same thing because they're uninformed and refuse to become informed.

l. Our demented, homicidal President who every day does something to undermine our democracy and now is trying to convince people he won the election. As his niece Mary Trump says, he is a sociopath who has no respect for our government institutions, traditions, or norms. He enables and validates psycho groups like Qanon and white supremecists who follow him as their cult leader. He is hands down the worst President we've ever had--truly evil. With him, cruelty is the point ,as can be seen from the way he's had children ripped from their parent's arms and put in cages!!!!

2.  People, like Governor Kristi Noem of S.D. and quack Doctor Scott Atlas, who encourage others to think of the Corona virus as a hoax, and to think of wearing masks, etc. as affronts to our freedoms. I have been furious at Kristi Noem who had the audacity to insult Governor Andrew Cuomo of N.Y. by comparing the job she's doing to his and saying his state had more deaths. For God's sake, South Dakota has fewer than 2,000,000 people.!!! She's an idiot!!!!

3. White supremecists make me furious, too. They think they are superior to those who are not like them, and they are nothing but uneducated nitwits who lack depth, awareness, compassion, wisdom, a moral compass, etc.--basically everything that makes up a person of character. They are fine with children in cages, as long as they're not ""white"" children.

It is for this reason that I try and live my life trying to please Him, with a heavy reliance on the work completed by Christ Jesus.

But this government would be headed by fallible human beings, themselves inherently selfish. Totalitarian governments often ascend under the guise of attractive promises from people with ""good intentions"". Their actions can be detrimental to the lives of those who value individual liberty.

Another thing that gets me most angry in my daily life is when someone insults or does not treat one of my friends or close acquaintances with respect. While people do not have to like or enjoy each other, it really hurts when you are talking with someone who makes fun of a friend, when that friend is either right there in the conversation or can't stand up for themselves.
Lastly, one thing that makes me most angry in my daily life is when people do not think about the consequences of their actions and how it might help or hurt others. Around our home area, no one picks up after their pets, and it bothers us because we don't want our pets to pick up disease or parasites from leftover waste. It's unsanitary, smelly, and takes all of ten seconds to clean up, and we do it without fail.",271,"",NA,1,5,2,1,7,2,14,5,6,1,2,2,14,NA,NA,NA,NA,2,2,1,2,15,1,2,1,1,2,7,1,8,4,3,9,5,2,6,1,1,1,1,1,3,4,1,1,40,2,1,4,3,5,2,5,5,2,2,1,1,4,3,5,2,6,3,3,2,4,3,2,3,3,3,4,1,"",NA,3,3,4,1,2,100,100,1,45,25,1,2,3,3,1,3,2,4,3,2,7,1,8,14,12,11,16,4,17,20,3,13,9,18,10,5,15,2,6,19,1,6,5,6,1,6,5,1,6,1,2,1,6,1,6,1,6,1,4,1,2,3,6,5,1,7,4,3,3,4,1,2,3,3,"John Smith",6,1,8,5,9,4,3,2,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,4,5,1,2,1,1,2,2,1,2,1,2,1,2,1,2,1,2,4,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,2,3,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,2,4,3,1,1,1,6,2,"11/19/2020 10:26","11/19/2020 10:46",20,2,1,"Desktop",1,34,2,2,1,5,5,1,10,"TX",3,7,0,1,2,3,4,1,0,0,0,0,1

I have a husband who is a type 2 diabetic and also has renal failure requiring dialysis.  We follow all the guidelines of wearing a mask, social distancing, etc.  My husband's health is even more serious than mine and if I catch it or he catches it, I fear it will be deadly. I wish everyone would take this virus seriously and take all the necessary precautions to keep themselves and others safe. I feel Americans feel entitled to do whatever they want and it's just not true in this instance.
I also have a fear of the dark.  As a young child (in second grade) I experienced a peeping tom while bathing.  I went to wipe the dew off the window and there was a man staring in.  Again, as an adult, I had a similar experience with a man looking through a crack in the curtain over the sliding glass door.  Now, whenever I have to walk alone in the dark I have an overwhelming fear that someone is going to come up behind me and stab me between my shoulder blades. I know it is an unrealistic fear, but nevertheless, I am fearful.
As a child, I had asthma and now, when I can't catch my breath or the air is stale (like having a blanket over my head), I become anxious.  I know I can't breathe when I am dead, but I am afraid of right before dying and not being able to breath.

I think it makes me so angry because it shows the level of ignorance and incompetence of my neighbor(s).  Even after I addressed it he claimed it was no big deal, that Trump was going to make America even greater anyway so he should be above it.  
Another thing that made me angry recently was that I found a phone on the ground walking home from school with my 1st and 4th graders.  We picked it up and on the front screen it said ""fuck you"".  I have no idea who's phone it was or how they had lost it but it made me want to leave it on the ground in the rain where I had found it.  Someone called the phone, I answered and said I was dropping it at the store to which it had service.  He asked if I would meet him somewhere to give the phone to him (the person who called, not the person who's phone it was) and I said no.  He asked why and I replied that the message on the phone and told me F - you so I wasn't going to go out of my way more than dropping it at the store.  I didn't want to know the person who's phone it was, or any of their friends.  
The third thing that makes me really angry is common core math.  I believe it's a good way to teach, and I think it's important.

That means me and my coworkers can give our all and it seemingly will not matter if it doesn't affect bottom line (we are creatives, working in marketing. I am a videographer.) We are vastly underpaid when compared to similar positions, and poorly managed with insufficient resources.

2) Republicans and far right groups: I know I am somewhat being polarized by the media, but I have rage towards groups in America who literally deny facts and science with their dying breath (calling Covid a hoax), turn a blind eye to police violence, killing of black people, killing of mexicans and children in border camps, and the poverty class of people dying from poor healthcare, etc. This world could easily be so much better if we actually valued education, science, and data, but religion and emotions are used to justify the horrors they bring upon this country. Every day I have to put an effort to not hating them by default, and understand the validity of some of their concerns.

3) Social media: This is in part similar to the last answer, in that social media rewards users with information that polarizes, by showing you what you WANT to see, so that you will click and interact.

I am a butch appearing lesbian and back in 1981 my appearance limited my opportunities in the work force and my socioeconomic status of never having had a man or children, which is how most women find economic security. I am pissed that I now must continue to rent, have neighbors that bother me and who I am now stuck hybernating during COVID with. I just want my own space and my own porch, not to battle about the damn porch (which I took over) with asshole young neighbors. Angry enough for you?
2. When someone knowingly takes advantage of me. I hate users and have lost a lot to them. The most recent was a 'friend' from grad school who started a therapy practice and I and others worked with/for her. Her finances were entirely opaque and I know she conned the insurance companies and us. I will never know how much money she cheated me out of, but working for a legit place, I'm surprised at how much I""m able to save now. Users in positions of power I can spot easily. Let's just say I've never been as angry at the government as I've been during the past 4 years: the using, the grifting, the lies, the money stealing. Loathesome.
3. Racist, sexist, homophobic acts and expressions. When my Queer identifed clients are heartbroken for years about rejecting parents and coworkers, when their mental health is impacted by social disgustingness, I am totally enraged.

My next area of a level of fear is the divisiveness within the country.  The 2020 election has shown that this country is severaly divided and we have a current President who does not care about Presidential traditions of a transition of power and acknowledging the there is a new President-Elect.  This is leading to a rise in people thinking there was some type of voter fraud when the current President won 4 years ago with a less margins than the President elect and have no proof of wide spread voter fraud.
