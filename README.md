# Political ads project
![Research Poster](https://github.com/domlockett/political_ads_experiment/blob/main/images/poster.jpg)

## Summary
In this project, we investigated social media usersâ€™ perceptions of digital political ads. We measured opinions on how platforms should design political ad UX and policies to establish a baseline understanding of user opinions, including the permissibility of political ads and microtargeting, and transparency in funding.

### Research Goals
The primary objective was to understand which ad factors (and user traits) contribute to perceptions of how 'political' digital ads are. We conducted a conjoint experiment with artificial Facebook ads, altering their source, content, and political orientation to isolate the effects on perceptions. A within-between experiment evaluated real ads from the Facebook Ad Library, asking respondents to rate their political perception.

### Findings
Our conjoint analysis supported hypotheses that the source, strength, and orientation of the message matter. Candidate ads were viewed as inherently political, whereas message strength mattered more for ads from companies and advocacy organizations.

## Methods
I joined post-survey implementation, maintaining and overseeing data integrity. I identified a random assignment error, leading to a survey reissuance. I implemented data analysis in R, using libraries such as `dplyr`, `magrittr`, and `tidyverse` for data cleaning, processing, and creating relevant variables.

## Main Contributions
- Collaborated with a multidisciplinary team, providing insights and recommendations based on key findings.
- Conducted exploratory data analysis using data visualization tools such as `ggplot2` and `plotly`.
- Identified a distribution error necessitating a survey reissuance.
- Implemented data transformation techniques including variable recoding, data aggregation, and normalization.
- Presented research findings at the Annual Conference for Political Methodology.


# Detailed Methods

# Data Cleaning and Transformations
## `political_ads_experiment/Publishing materials/rep_cleaning-data.R`

The `rep_cleaning-data.R` script is essential for preparing the dataset and ensuring its quality and consistency.

**Key Tasks:**
- **Variable Recoding:** Standardizes categorical variables, such as political affiliations, for consistency across datasets.
- **Data Aggregation:** Aggregates data at various levels, like individual respondent and ad levels, to facilitate different types of analysis.
- **Normalization:** Uses z-score normalization to scale numerical variables, making them comparable.
- **Missing Data Imputation:** Applies predictive mean matching (PMM) to handle missing data, minimizing bias.

## Statistical Modeling
### `political_ads_experiment/Publishing materials/rep_main-models.R`
This script builds and evaluates statistical models to understand the relationship between ad characteristics and political perceptions.

**Key Tasks:**
- **Model Specification:** Utilizes linear and logistic regression models to analyze data.
- **Model Fitting:** Employs `lm` for linear regression and `glm` for logistic regression, using robust standard errors with the `lm_robust` function from the `estimatr` package to account for heteroscedasticity and improve model reliability.
- **Diagnostic Checks:** Conducts checks for multicollinearity, heteroscedasticity, and influential observations to ensure model validity.
- **Output Presentation:** Uses the `texreg` package to create regression tables, preferred over `stargazer` for its advanced formatting options and ease of integration with LaTeX documents.


# Model data
## `political_ads_experiment/Publishing materials/rep_main-models.R`
This script analyzes data from a comprehensive study on political advertising and transparency. It processes survey responses, conjoint experiment results, and real advertisement data to explore public perceptions and the impact of various ad attributes.

## Dependencies
- tidyverse
- ggplot2
- cjoint
- lme4
- stargazer
- estimatr

## Data Sources

- TASS survey data
- Conjoint experiment data
- Real advertisement data from multiple surveys

## Key Analyses

1. **Conjoint Analysis**: Examines the impact of ad attributes like message orientation, source type, and image on viewer perceptions.

2. **Opinion Survey**: Processes responses to questions about political ad regulations.

3. **Real Ad Impact**: Analyzes the effect of ads from various sources (e.g., Trump, Biden, Patagonia, Exxon) on viewer perceptions.

4. **Stacked Experiment**: Combines data across experiments to compare effects of different ad types (candidate, organization, company).


# Visualization
## `political_ads_experiment/Publishing materials/rep_main-plots.R`

The `rep_main-plots.R` script creates detailed visualizations to effectively communicate findings.

## Dependencies

- ggplot2
- stargazer
- texreg
- gridExtra
- and others (refer to the main script for a complete list)

## Main Components

### Conjoint Experiment Visualization (Fig. 1)
- Creates an AMCE (Average Marginal Component Effect) plot for the unconditional model
- Customizes plot appearance with specific colors and themes

### Interaction Effects Plot (Fig. 2)
- Visualizes the interaction between message orientation, source orientation, and prior attitudes
- Uses custom color schemes and formatting

### Real Advertisement Analysis
- Generates plots and tables for the pooled analysis of real political advertisements
- Includes mean comparisons across different ad types (Fig. 4)

### Opinion Survey Analysis
- Processes survey data on topics like ad funding disclosure and public databases

### Statistical Output Formatting
- Uses `texreg` and `stargazer` to create publication-ready tables of model results
