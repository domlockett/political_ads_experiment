Win a free copy of Forgive Us
The Earth ended slowly, asphyxiated by man's drive for energy and silenced by fire and brimstone.

In the hopeless dystopian remnants, there is only the struggle to survive and endure.

Oliver, a lone rider bearing the scars of the old world, flees east into the untamed lands beyond the Rocky Mountains. He spearheads the frontier and carries the burden of civilization into the new world, destined to rebuild from the ruins. He has to survive the wasteland where the earth is toxic, and the very air itself is a corrosive poison.

London, a veteran of the wasteland, shields his adopted daughter Rose from an unforgiving world. They live in a new age that'll soon draw them into the bitter feuds between fledgling nations. No matter what, London will sacrifice anything for Rose. Unbeknownst to London, they are about to be drawn right into the scourge of war.

Simon, a man born and raised on the great Arcadis space station, faces suppressive pressure from The Peacekeepers and The Leaders. Ever the tinkerer, Simon needs to be careful as he breaks the authoritarian rules in the world he has to live in.

Reminiscent of The Gunslinger and The Stand, E.T. Gunnarsson's Forgive Us provides an action-packed post-apocalyptic introduction for those wanting to explore adult horror dystopian fiction.

Wyrmwood: Quality Gaming Supplies
Support Crazy Ed's Wedding!
When ""Crazy"" Ed and got engaged, we wanted to find a way to help. After he showed us what he had done with the broken remains of a couple of Lilliput tables, we knew just how to do it. Thank you, Wyrmlings, for considering contributing to the wedding fund! Donations will close at 11:59PM Eastern October 30th, 2020. The winner will be drawn on October 31st.   About the Frankenput The table is constructed from the remains of two tables, a Wenge and Purpleheart Lilliput. You can see what they looked like before here:   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSDW_SPf8Ro  There's a lot going on to bring these tables back to life - the bullet holes are filled with glow in the dark epoxy, for one - and, honestly, it shouldn't have worked. This thing is clearly a monster, and Crazy Ed has perverted the laws of nature to make this happen. Of course, that's kind of his thing. More on the table here: https://youtu.be/oEldkeDIz6w   About ""Crazy"" Ed   ""Crazy"" Ed is an employee at Keystone Collections, the fine furniture manufacturer Wyrmwood has partnered with over the years, and has now formally acquired to join forces with permanently. A mild-mannered craftsman by day, by night he transforms into the combination of outlaw, mad scientist and sower of havoc that you just can't make up . (Okay, fine, he's not THAT mild-mannered by day, either.) We wish he and his fiance Jacquie many years of happiness together, and just the right amount of crazy. With luck, we'll be around to capture some of it, too.

Spalted Tamarind Sketch Pencil
The Wyrmwood Sketch Pencil is a compact, 3mm lead pencil for sketches, drafting and more. See our Mechanical Pencil for a more traditional 0.7mm option. Each and every pencil is hand-turned, resulting in a beautiful finish. A built-in sharpener allows you to easily keep it writing its best. Thoughtful contours complete the design, ensuring that it feels natural in the hand. Each Wyrmwood Sketch Pencil includes a complimentary high-polymer eraser. Spalted Tamarind The dark lines in Spalted Tamarind can be seen as “property lines” between competing types of fungus. In pieces of spalted wood, the fungus is allowed to infect the wood to just the right point, then stopped before the wood becomes unusable. Retrieved at just the right time, each piece of Spalted Tamarind will have a unique appearance, making it a very popular exotic selection.

It features stone-oiled water buffalo leather for the rolling surface, as well as magnets for connecting to other Tabletop Tiles and posts for stacking.   Padauk Padauk is an exotic wood that is a bright orange or almost crimson wood when freshly cut, but oxidizes to a darker, rich purple-brown over time. It is a good wood in all respects – stable, and easy to work with. It often grows in small groups and is reported to be common in dense equatorial rain forests.
