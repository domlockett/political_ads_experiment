March 6–April 17, 2020
Receptions: March 13, 5–8pm and April 10, 5–8pm

100 Years of Freedom honors the centennial anniversary of women’s right to vote in the United States with artwork that explores the concept of freedom. This exhibition brings together diverse expressions of freedom, from depictions of important historical and contemporary figures and iconic symbolism to personal interpretations and celebrations of art as an act of freedom. Many of the artworks are politically driven and aim to deepen public discourse around important subjects such as women’s rights, immigration, and climate change. 100 Years of Freedom reminds us that the fight for equality and freedom in this country continues.

"1. Will MacNeil uses a trash picker to extract plastic bottles, cups, take-out containers and other garbage from between the boulders at Sunset Point along the Pacific Coast Highway in Malibu. Will volunteers with the Surfrider Foundation once a month, offering yoga classes with his partner Amanda Ferree. Classes are held on the beach before clean-ups and all proceeds are donated to The Surfrider Foundation. ⠀

"2020 was supposed to be a good year—blessed with another trip around the sun. 

Then the unimaginable happened in a matter of months—Who would have thought?

We all know we could lose our jobs at the drop of a hat. I used to think that I was safe. I used to think I was one of the lucky ones---till I wasn’t…

If you had told me this would all happen in a matter of 6 months—I would have laughed you out the door…Till it happened 

So I had to find a new DIRECTION. 

A CHANGE to my life.

That change came from a BUSINESS that had the RIGHT fit for me. It was a group of people—a group of like-minded individuals that wanted that same CHANGE. It was a group of people that also dug, clawed, and forced their way out of the of the rat race and became OWNERS, DOERS, LEADERS instead of followers…instead of employees..

But before I tell you more, let’s see if this sounds familiar?

My name is Alex. I am 46 years old. 
A father…husband.. and by the grace of GOD—a grandfather.
 
I am supposed to be the rock, the lighthouse for my family 
And I was, till our world fell out from under us. 
It came crashing down like a ton of bricks---oil fell below worthless.

Being in the oilfield for 20 years—what was I to do then?
This year took 20 years of DEDICATION to my job and made it mean nothing.
But how can this be?

I am stuck picking up the pieces with a family that depends on me. 2020 has been the hardest for me and my family…Can you believe that? 

Jobs are cut. 
Unemployment has increased dramatically. 
Along with thousands around the world, had taken pay cuts. 
Hours were cut. 
Layoffs happened.

On April 20 I got the call!! 
I was laid off…UNBELIEVABLE!!! I have never been laid off!! What was I going to do?

As I left the office that day—I was wondering how am I going to let my wife know that I was just laid off??
My mind was running like a freight train!!! What really stuck with me was, I was tired of the UNKNOWN!

I have been through some SETBACKS in the oil and gas industry…

But this time was different—I didn't want to go through this again. 

I thought to myself:
I have a college degree that took me 10 years to get while working. I missed out on a lot with my family.
I DEDICATED myself to ACHIEVING that GOAL and it turned out to be one of the best days of my life!!!

It opened doors of OPPORTUNITY for me, and helped me move up the ladder but NEVER REACHED THE TOP!!

I needed to try something DIFFERENT and then one day while scrolling the internet I came across an advertisement that stated--I could start my own business—be my own BOSS.
Have total CONTROL of my LIFESTYLE!! It sounded GREAT!!

Its set up with FREE Training that explains the business UPFRONT with the tools needed to be SUCCESSFUL. 

It also comes with COACHING from the start to guide you with the proper steps that you will need. 

And let me just say that I have never been a part of a group or community that has been so supportive with helping me and guiding me in the right direction with starting my business. 
They are always there for me when I need anything. 

THAT MAKES A BIG DIFFERENCE!!

WHY NOT?

Next time you are sitting around take a good look back at your life and ask yourself: What have i done with my life? Where am I going? What have I accomplished?

Do you like the answers that are popping up in your head?

OVERWORKED?...
UNDER APPRECIATED?...
UNDER PAID?...
UNSATISFIED?...
MOTIVATED?...
DETERMINED FOR SOMETHING BETTER?...

Let me share this opportunity with you—an opportunity that will give FREEDOM and INDEPENDENCE!!!

Drop “CHANGE MY LIFE” below or send me a message to get you started!!

Thank you!!

"32% of plastic litters our environment. 40% of plastic ends up in a landfill. 14% is incinerated, and 14% is recycled. But only 2% of that effectively recycled and reutilize.
.
Given this inconvenient reality, scientists have created a mutant bacteria that breaks down plastic packaging for recycling in just hours. The enzyme, first discovered in a compost heap, reduces plastic to the chemical building blocks that were originally used to make high-quality, new packaging.
.
The company responsible for the breakthrough, @carbioshq, says its aiming for industrial-level recycling within just five years. It has also partnered with major companies like @pepsi and @loreal.
.
Billions of metric tons of plastic waste have polluted our environment. Let us campaign for sustainable innovation like this!

"4 beds 2 bathrooms - Flat

PRIVATE BEDROOM with a shared bathroom. Free month, then $850 a month. ALL INCLUSIVE AT THE VIEW, NO SECURITY DEPOSIT. Basically on Temple Campus. Would work best for a make or female student but it is not required.  Let's make a deal. reduced again $850.  This reduced rate is like getting over three months free. its a nearly $3500 discount. The View at Montgomery starting this fall. All utilities and amenities included in a 4 bedroom, 2 bathroom suite. Will negotiate and will pay the difference upon taking over the lease, security deposit included. The view has been a safe and convenient place for my daughter and I have always felt good about her living there while at Temple. My daughter has thoroughly enjoyed living there and it has been easy to manage, but plans have changed and she will not be returning this fall. Willing to listen to offers if you message me directly. If you think you need a better deal, tell me why, ill listen, need to move on from this lease.

"5 Ways You Can Fix Air Pollution From The Inside: 

1. Candles vs diffusers - The majority of candles contain harmful chemicals that, when burned, release toxins into the air. Switching to diffusers is a healthier alternative. Many are cost-effective, safe around kids and pets, no nasty chemicals and you can control your fragrance output. Since diffusers do not require a flame, you can keep place them virtually anywhere. Our current favorite is doTERRA.

2. All electric appliances - Gas appliances produce a range of air pollutants with both acute and chronic health effects. Choosing to build all-electric does not only protect public health and safety, it also lowers energy bills and construction costs, and help stop the climate crisis. 

3. Smart Vacuum - Using anti-allergy vacuums with a true HEPA filter can trap 99.97 percent of airborne particles, helping to bring you some much needed allergy relief. Most standard vacuums just blow these particles back into the air. This is why using a good, top-rated vacuum cleaner with a built-in HEPA filter can be so beneficial

4. Humidifiers - During the cold periods, a humidifier adds moisture to the air. The increased humidity can relieve dry skin and eyes, allergy and asthma symptoms, and sore throat, so you feel more comfortable. Most humidifiers come with filters that trap allergens, dirt, dust, and other particles

5. Smart Thermostats - a smart thermostat is a champ at adjusting your HVAC unit to maintain a comfortable temperature. It can also help you save a few bucks on energy costs by setting back automatically, but there’s another benefit, a healthier indoor environment. In addition to gaining control over certain IAQ components, a smart thermostat when integrated with an automation system becomes an even more useful tool at maintaining a healthy home environment. For example, your smart home can send status reports to whatever device you choose: smartphone, tablet, or in-wall touchscreen. You can receive notifications when levels are off. It’s a great way to gain a better understanding of how your habits might affect the indoor air."

"About the Author:
The author, a retired Earth Scientist,  specialized in the evaluation of environmental data for 36 years, after obtaining a master of science degree in 1980. As part of his career in academia, industry, and state government, he has studied the complex interactions and patterns associated with environmental variability, including sea level rise, water quality, and climate, publishing several research papers along the way. His work and play in the South Louisiana bayou country, in an area ravaged by hurricanes, sea level rise, land loss , and human impact, along with a deep personal faith, inspired him to follow a career path that promotes the betterment and balance of society toward stewardship and the responsible utilization of resources, without compromising human advancements in technology, commerce, entertainment, comfort, and life expectancy.
 
The Book:
The climate change debate is an environmental debate. It  is fueled by the assumption that climate variability can be controlled by man-made changes in planetary dynamics greater than natural atmospheric oscillations, that technology and the use of fossil fuels causes these changes, and that two hundred years of data out of thousands is enough to prove or disprove the destruction of our planet by humans. That mankind has this kind of influence-as insignificant in space and time as it is compared to the size, age, and energy of creation-is within the shadow of reason and doubt. Yet as the only known survivor of creation and the only known conscious life in the universe, mankind has the responsibility and duty to harness the energy of the universe, use it to its advantage, and respect it. To what extent has humanity contributed to the degradation of our air, water, and soil, that the Earth is doomed as an uninhabitable sphere? It has turned into a social and economic debate as well. Shouldn’t we, as an intelligent lifeform, have a right to use the Earth’s resources to any extent required to maintain our species and its evolution toward a secure and comfortable habitation of the planet?"
"Above all other dreams, hopes, and ambitions for Thousand Fell has been our desire to make circular products more accessible to more people. We started with sneakers because they're universally loved. They are also frequently worn through and one of the biggest waste offenders in the fashion industry. To solve this we have swapped out materials with a focus on recycling and have built a closed loop system. We have worked tirelessly with a team of experts to make our dream sneaker — one we love to wear that also does better for our planet 🌍 Our promise is to keep doing better and better."
"According to the Tom Steyer campaign website, the candidate is, “committed to combating climate change, fixing our government, and, when elected president, putting people, and not corporations, in charge of our democracy,” but what will his promises, plans, goals and ideas mean for Black America and other people of color?

That’s just one of the questions that Steyer, one of a still large field of candidates seeking to represent he Democratic Party in this year’s election, will be asked during this lively exchange.

"According to Zillow home values in FL will rise 4.1% by going solar this year; that's a $12,300 increase on a $300k home. 

  Added to the obvious reduction in carbon footprint and reducing climate change, the other awesome benefits of solar power include:

✔️ A home's electric bill drops to near $0. Pretty cool! 👍

✔️No More policing 👮🏻‍♂️ the thermostat. Enjoy the comfort and freedom to heat or cool the house at any time.

✔️ Homeowners that qualify for solar receive a 26% federal tax credit. Pretty Great, right? (source: Consumer Reports) 👏

"""A CLEANER OCEAN"", is the vision of Rivers.Global. 
Just before the covid-19 pandemic hit the world, I was reminded of the importance of this as I took a stroll at the Sola Beach of Norway. Cold water of course in March, but still, the water was ever so clean! What a contrast to the photo taken by Lekima Hung of a beach in Tuy Phong, Vietnam. Lekima drove his motorbike from north to south in Vietnam to make a photo documentary of plastic pollution in the country. This is one of the photos, find more at https://rivers.global/en/home/
There you will also find the 2019 Annual Report: https://rivers.global/wp-content/uploads/Annual-Report-2019-1.pdf
There are of course beautiful beaches in Vietnam, always with better temperatures than Norway, but sadly enough there are many beaches with lots of astray plastic. 
Should you like to support our work for a cleaner ocean, you are of course very welcome. Best of regards from Martin Alvsvåg, chairman of the Board."

"A Crisis Inside a Crisis: What Covid Might Teach Us About Dealing With Climate 

""There are no silver linings to a pandemic, but if we're going to go through this kind of trauma we might as well learn some things--here's my sense of what we should be thinking about as we come out of quarantine. Reality is real, since we've delayed so long, speed now matters, and solidarity is most important of all"". -- Bill McKibben

Around the world, weary people in many countries have begun to chart the promising slide of daily coronavirus cases and deaths—but the other crisis curves on our planet—the endless rises of temperature and carbon-dioxide concentration—show no such mercy. As the world draws more and more parallels between the COVID-19 and climate crisis, Bill McKibben's message of equity and justice resonates as we work towards solutions that effectively combat both crises simultaneously. Join NAZCCA, Fridays For Future, and Bill McKibben for an online talk and Q&A session.

"ACTION ALERT - PLEASE HELP:
We spent Leap Day 2020 out in the streets trying to get the word out to Boulder, CO residents about the proposal being reviewed that could lead to the deaths of close to 30,000 prairie dogs on Boulder Open Space property with irrigated ag parcels.

Very few people were aware that these animals were being considered for proposed killing instead of them being relocated or other non-lethal management efforts being employed. They were unaware that the ag community petitioned the City to change their policy and skip all other management methods and jump straight to KILLING and do it immediately! There is never a good reason to destroy a native keystone species to protect non-native species, rather it is for cattle, grasses, etc. in any other instance, native species take precedence.

The picture with this post contains approximately 350-375 prairie dogs that were poisoned by one man. The number of animals that would be poisoned if this proposal is adopted would be 80 times greater than this photo and does not include all other species living with prairie dogs in their burrows. The sheer number of animals being considered for poisoning is astounding. The loss of these huge numbers of prey species will lead to major conflicts with local predators looking to feed themselves and their young. It is very possible and quite likely there would be major crashes in the successful rearing of young in dens and raptor nests across the region. This would be a massive hit to our native ecosystem which could take decades for the environment to recover from, if at all.

We ask that you please contact the Boulder City Council members and the Open Space Board of Trustee members and let them know that you DO NOT SUPPORT THIS PROPOSED KILLING PLAN ON BOULDER OPEN SPACE.
(Be polite!)

"After 14 weeks of Fire Drill Fridays in Washington, DC, Jane Fonda and Greenpeace USA have taken Fire Drill Fridays to California! We’re doing monthly Fire Drills – on the first Friday of each month – in different locations around California. In February, we came together with the Last Chance Alliance at Los Angeles City Hall to call on California Governor Gavin Newsom to step up on climate. Next up, we’re bringing Fire Drill Fridays to the heart of the oil and gas impacts in Wilmington, CA on March 6th, to send a loud and clear message that the health of communities and the climate are of far more importance than the fossil fuel industry! And you’re invited!

Join us at 11am PT at San Pedro City Hall,  638 S. Beacon St., San Pedro, CA 90731

Why Wilmington? 
Wilmington, Los Angeles is a prime example of why Governor Newsom must prioritize the health and safety of Californians over the profits of fossil fuel companies. In Wilmington right now, Warren Energy & Power is putting families at risk with its toxic drilling practices — some of the neighborhood ranks among the top 5% of communities with the highest pollution exposure in the state! It’s making people sick and putting the world at risk by locking in the worst effects of climate change.

Fossil Fuels are strangling our communities and our democracy. The world is literally burning, from the Amazon to Australia, and fossil fuels are the biggest contributor to that. 
When our house is on fire, as Greta Thunberg said, what do you do? Join Jane and Fire Drill Fridays friends on March 6th as we demand a just transition off of fossil fuels, a Green New Deal, 2500 foot setbacks, and No New Fossil Fuels!! The event is being hosted by Greenpeace USA, Communities For A Better Environment, and Stand Together Against Neighborhood Drilling ."

"After several cash-direct-to-taxpayers and other stimulus bills were enacted recently, a few auto manufacturers are pushing Congress to enact a new iteration of the Cash for Clunkers program — and quickly.

There were at least two versions of the 2009 bill. The idea of all such bills were:

-Get people to buy new vehicles, thereby spending money.
-Get old and decrepit vehicles off the road.
-Improve overall fuel economy, reduce air pollution and cut back on carbon dioxide emissions which is one of the main drivers of global climate change.

"A GREENER FESTIVAL
WHO:   private and publicly funded
WHAT:  A three-day private and publicly funded public affair
WHEN:  JULY ~26-28, 2020
WHERE:  The Evergreen State College Campus 
WHY:  To be ready for the ensuing changes bought on by Global Climate Change

HOW?:  A number research presentations, of shows and a music by local bands, a center for culinary experiences as there will be a number of how-to, and DIY demonstrations, also films on introducing many changes that Washingtonians will have to make so that we will be able to join the global movement to combat climate change as it becomes an existential threat not only our environment but to our planet itself.

The three-day private and publicly funded public affair to be held on the Evergreen campus as the college has been chosen  because of its pro ecological stance and educational facilities and as it provides the needed space to accommodate such a festival.  

Some of the purposes of the ‘Greener Festival other than it being an extravaganza, a gala, a show and research presentations, and a music fest, there will be a number of, new up and coming companies showcasing their wares and services, also how-to demonstrations on to introduce many changes that Olympians will have to make so that we will be able to join the global movement to combat climate change which has become an existential threat to our planet.  

This past October the world’s leading climate scientists have already warned us that there is about a dozen years left for global warming to be kept to a maximum of 1.5C, beyond which even half a degree will significantly magnify the risks of drought, floods, extreme heat and poverty for literally hundreds of millions of people. 

We will do what we must for future generations and the cause. Education and activism are the only keys for desired change and a healthier sustainable future.  Join us as we learn about making the transition of our society to a just and sustainable future!

"A ‘Greener’ New Global Deal
By Allan Hill

Hello, my name is Allan Hill and I am the creator of the Facebook site A Green New Global Deal and I ask you to remember that the fight over climate change is not just for us. It is our children and their children who will be dealing with the full effects of climate change and the reshaping environment . It is time to do the right thing for future generations of our very planet as they will be the recipients of change and yet what these changes are on you and I. This is a fight that we cannot afford to lose.
I am tired of being lied to by my own country, so you can say that I AM MAD AS HELL AND I AM NOT TAKING THIS ANYMORE. I AM A VETERAN, A BISEXUAL MALE, A PHOTOJOURNALIST, A BUDDHIST, A BELIEVER IN PEOPLE in that they will do the right thing when push comes to shove. The U.S. has lied to me for the last time. We must come together as a nation and begin to clean our own house. NOW IS THE TIME. LET’S DO THIS.
As a Caucasian male of Iroquois Nation and Scot descent I have always had other voices in my blood and they are older and much wiser. I have learnt from them and abide by them. Being human and having made my share of mistakes in life, however in examining my life in a critical context I have learned that when people of conscience do nothing when they are called the earth dies just a little bit more every time.
We are all just mere fibers in this web of life where we are inextricably connected to each other in one way or another, and whether one choses to believe it or not, what happens to one community affects all communities. When one segment of society is marginalized for so long it is society at large that that will pay the exacting price.
As a veteran in taking the Oath of Enlistment I swore to “support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies “foreign and domestic.” The last time I looked, the rights of ALL citizens were NOTinclusive in their politics. While the U.S. purports to spread democracy abroad, it also has a history of actively suppressing women, females, African Americans, and maligned minorities and the disabled at home. Remember, it’s “Not me. Us”

 In 2012 I had a daydream in which I experienced one possible future for all of humanity. Two years later, a second vision was played out roughly mimicking my dream of months earlier although this one had a definite message-“SOMETHING BEAUTIFUL” IS GOING TO HAPPEN. Also in the dream was an event that happened at Evergreen. A Three-day public and privately funded festival and at its very heart is A Green New Global Deal. The July 2020 three day affair will expound on every aspect of our changing environment through public lectures, a theatre showing top notch documentaries, tented corporate presentations showcasing show and tell product demonstrations. Also included in the happening at the The Evergreen State College. A physicist told me once that we live in a “persistent universe.” I will accept this as a badge of faith, so with that I take the city of Olympia and The Evergreen State College to task. We demand “A GREENER NEW GLOBAL DEAL” Festival this July 24-26, 2020.
Our planet is crying out for help. For drastic change. Be that change! Speak up, Act up . . . for mother Earth and all of her inhabitants. All of her species. If you drink water or breath air, love someone, this war is on you. This is a crucial moment we live in. We are in the moment of a massive extinction. We have never known a planet like this. Nothing is the same anymore. THIS CHANGES EVERYTHING!
Presently houseless, I am a 68 year-old activist who has a speech problem-I cannot seem to shut up. Missing creature comforts such as a word processor I do manage as I do have an iPhone. My only email that I do currently trust is batai52@yahoo.com. In closing I ask you: How much do you want change? Then help me and PLEASE SHARE THIS. NEVER SAY QUIT!
Peace, Joy n’ Harmony, Allan Hill"

"A LOCAL'S GUIDE TO MAIN STREET

For Frisco, the 1980s were a time of growth and transformation. The Dillon Dam was finished, the Eisenhower Tunnel had been completed, the nearby ski area of Copper Mountain, Breckenridge, and Keystone were expanding and the sports of skiing and snowboarding were more popular than ever. It was the decade that saw Frisco become a destination in its own right.

Some of the more momentous changes for Frisco in the 80s included the dedication and ribbon cutting ceremony for the new Town hall which was attended by Colorado Governor Richard Lamm.

Frisco's original one room school house was added to the National Registry of Historical Places on December 15, 1983. Also, the Frisco Historic Park and Museum was established and over the next several years the Historic Park has acquired a total of 11 buildings.

It was also in the 1980s that a forward thinking teacher had his students put together a time capsule of what they believed to be important to them and the world in 1983-1984 school year. There will be a ceremony in 2018 to open this time capsule.

The growth and development of Frisco has continued in the decades following the 80s, and Frisco has rightfully claimed an important position in Summit County. Frisco continues to attract more and more visitors and new residents each year, all who come to enjoy what our mountain community has to offer.

"A lot of parents are doing their best to teach their children skills that will serve them well when they become adults. However, many overlook an essential attribute to pass down to their kids, & that is environmental consciousness.
_______
As children, we grew up learning about the hole in the ozone layer & the threat of global warming. Now, as parents, we’re raising our children to be aware of different environmental issues, such as green energy & the war on plastic. Here are a few tips on how you can raise eco-friendly children:
_______
1- Spend Time in Nature 
Take them to places like parks to play, out fishing, for bicycle rides and on hiking trails or even for camping. In the process, your children will associate the outdoors with fun, and then it will be easy for them to have respect for and adopt habits that conserve the environment
_______
2- Parent By Example
This means doing things in front of AND with your kids. You can recycle, conserve water, food & energy, garden, choose products that have no plastic/no waste packaging, plant trees, pass on toys/clothes to others, and walk instead of drive
_______
3- DIY Projects 
Recycling or reusing things such as cardboard boxes, toilet rolls, plastic bottle and even glass ones. It’s a fun way to keep them busy and also show them that trash can become art or turn into something useful
_______
4- Love Animals & Bugs
Animals are affected by pollution in a big way, and you need to explain this to your children. By explaining to them how important it is to keep the environment clean as waste harms animals and makes it unsafe for them to live in their habitats, it will help them become aware of how they treat their surroundings
_______
5- Community Efforts & Projects
Involve other parents in activities
You can organize carpools, arrange tree planting or gardening exercises, host play dates where you make objects from recycled materials. You can also organize an outing to clean up a local area! 
_______
6- Read books! 
There are many ways to teach children to take care of the planet, and one simple yet powerful approach is through books! Swipe to see our recommendations 😍 scroll through our feed for the reviews!"

"American Oil and Gas Companies are Committed to Economic and Environmental Progress
By: Anne Bradbury, AXPC CEO

When we talk about an American energy revolution, one of the first things that come to mind is the raw perseverance and grit of American energy producers. For years, wildcatters in states like Texas, Oklahoma and Louisiana threw everything they had – time, resources and physical labor – into finding and producing the oil and gas that was needed to power their local economies and provide power to America.

 That commitment led to technological innovations like hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling – and the ability to pull unheard of amounts of oil and gas from our vast natural resources in a safe and sustainable manner. These resources don’t just heat our homes and power our cars but are used by manufacturers as the raw materials to build other innovative American products that we rely on for modern life.  From make-up to the iPhone to electric vehicles, oil and gas – produced by American companies – are powering and furthering innovation across a multitude of American industries.

 That results in jobs and economic benefits that ripple across our local, state and national economies. America’s oil and natural gas industry supports nearly 8 percent of the U.S. GDP and over 10.9 million full and part-time jobs through direct employment and indirect support to other sectors of the economy.  And, tax revenue generated from oil and gas production goes directly to funding public schools, building access roads and supporting our first responders. 

Importantly, American oil and natural gas companies are also committed to continued environmental progress. We continue to apply the best of what we’ve learned about energy production to further reduce emissions and minimize our environmental footprint.  We apply new, cutting-edge technologies to do so in the most efficient and sustainable way possible. 

The little covered and often ignored truth is that we are seeing positive environmental outcomes, while our economy grows. Since 1970, implementation of the Clean Air Act and technological advances from American innovators like us have dramatically improved air quality in the U.S. According to EPA, from 2005 to 2017, total U.S. energy-related CO2 emissions fell by 14 percent, all while the U.S. became the number one energy producer in the world. And, since 1990, U.S. natural gas production more than doubled.  Over that same period, methane emissions from natural gas production fell by over 16 percent. 

In addition to complying with extensive federal, state, and local regulations, our members develop and implement industry standards, share best practices, facilitate chemical and water use disclosures, and work with regulators to ensure their operations responsibility protect water resources. 

For example, American oil and gas companies voluntarily participate in The Environmental Partnership – an organization that is committed to identifying and implementing environmental solutions that are technically feasible, commercially proven and result in significant emissions reductions.

 We are committed to this progress – both economic and environmental – because we believe in investing in the long-term future and well-being of the communities in which our people live, work and raise their families.

We are America’s energy revolution, and we are proud of this progress.

"A month from today on June 20th is World Refugee Day. Yet the tragedy is heart-wrenching all year. Today, Cyclone Amphan devastated parts of India and Bangladesh claiming lives and leaving millions without homes. This adds to the 70 million people already left homeless while bearing the loss, desperation and fear that comes with it. Solutions to such an overwhelming problem often feel elusive and we are left with the choice to light a candle or curse the darkness. 

At B4G, we wholeheartedly believe we can contribute to alleviating suffering and helping those in need. We believe part of the solution is to understand the utility of bamboo and to use this natural resource to its full potential as the world's fastest growing plant!

Bamboo can be used to:
• Create buffer zones that protect vulnerable areas • Sequester carbon to mitigate the drastic effects of climate change • Create livelihoods and economic opportunities • Restore degraded lands 
• As building materials for everything from shelter to items of critical need that are pivotal to health and safety at every refugee camp in the world • And so much more!

So, today, we are asking you to light a candle. It doesn't have to be expensive or hard or time consuming. Share this post, tell a friend about bamboo and our mission, donate $1 or $10 or even $100! What you choose to do can makes a difference. Today, choose to believe in the power of human ingenuity, perseverance, and love. And light a match, a candle, or maybe a huge bonfire.

“Darkness cannot drive out darkness: only light can do that."" - Martin Luther King Jr.

"An adorable Loggerhead Sea Turtle hatchling ventures to the sea! 🐢 
Loggerhead turtles are listed as a vulnerable species under the US Endangered Species Act as populations experienced significant declines due to a loss of nesting habitat from coastal development, nest predation, and human disturbances (like light pollution). 
💙 💙 💙 💙 💙 
When hatching, baby loggerheads will follow the reflection of the moonlight off the ocean water across the beach to the tideline. As they make this dash across the sand, they imprint on their location. Thirty years from now when these turtles reach reproductive age, females will return to @LittleStSimonsIsland 's beaches or to neighboring beaches to lay nests of their own.
💙 💙 💙 💙 💙 
Minimizing coastal development, turtle bycatch, and light pollution and habitat disruptions are the best ways to help protect Loggerhead populations. Here on Little St. Simons Island, every guests' stay contributes to the support of Loggerhead conservation efforts and we hope to see turtles, like this hatchling, returning to nest on our beaches three decades from now!

Thank you to our DNR Turtle Tech Natalie for capturing this video while conducting her daily nest surveys!"
"Ancient Natural Ingredient is the NEW BUZZ for Immediate Plumpness Elasticity & Tone... 400x the hydrating power of Hyaluronic Acid.

Widely used in Asia, for centuries, and recently scientists are impressed with more studies involving Snow Mushroom Extract.

Studies show that Snow Mushroom Extract has 400x the hydrating power of Hyaluronic Acid!

No wonder, once it is known that this powerful extract, is rich in protein, containing 18 of the 20 known amino acids. Isn't it amazing? Plus a broad variety of vitamins and minerals.

Used topically in skincare, proved to shield the skin against oxidative damage at the same time it supports the skin to hold up water. 

That's the reason it is perfect for making the skin look plump, and firm.

Snow Mushroom Extract is one of the greatest skincare recent discoveries as it claims to reduce drastically the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles.

In the same scientific study, it was possible to see those particles of Snow Mushroom Extract, in the deep layers of the skin, creating microfilm, holding up water into the skin cells making hydration last longer.

It was also detected that in the deep layers of the skin, the Snow Mushroom Extract, generates natural elasticity, tone and fit appearance to the skin.

The Amazing Natural Face Volumizer

UFlawless is proud to announce that we have developed a product formulated with Medical-Grade strength combining the Cutting-Edge, Natural Actives, and Ingredients to plump your skin in two hours!

It's the X3 Face Volumizer - It's not just a promise that your skin will look plumper, vibrant, and lively in a matter of two hours. It's a reality.

Made with the perfect combination of Hyaluronic Acid, Snow Mushroom Extract, Ginseng, and Fruit Extracts, this next-generation anti-aging product is causing already a lot of buzz.

We have one customer from Miami/FL who said: ""It's like using injectable wrinkle fillers, without actually the discomfort of the injections!""

The X3 Face Volumizer provides instant hydration and plump appearance due to the combination of Hyaluronic Acid and Snow Mushroom Extract.

At the same time as the Ginseng, and Fruit Extracts deliver protection from free-radical damage. Caused by cigarette smoke, pollution, sun exposure, and artificial light, such as cell phones and computer screens.

It is the perfect product for replenishing hydration from summer, and winter stress on the skin.

The X3 Face Volumizer bring that immediate good feeling of a refreshed skin, as soon as you put on your face, lasting for 24 hours. 

Of course, if you keep applying for the next two weeks, there's no better feeling to describe how vibrant, and alive your skin will be.

Here are the reasons why immediate plumpness, elasticity & tone happens:

1) Our Medical-Grade formulation can reach the deep layers of the skin.

2) Associated with Snow Mushroom Extract, which has smaller particles than hyaluronic acid, promoting long term results. Reported by 88% of users, in recent clinical testing.

Enhancing Beauty, Overall Luminosity and Vibrancy Of The Skin

3) Contamination-Free Bottles and Pumps - The bottles and pumps are made to be stored without any contact with air, avoiding contamination from external factors

"A NEWS UPDATE FROM OBIFD (3/23/20):
 
   In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Town of Harpswell has issued an emergency proclamation,  which imparts to the community the gravity of the situation and makes it easier for the Town to access additional resources, if needed. 
      The town office on Mountain Road remains closed for at least the rest of this week. The Recycling Center/Transfer Station is now open Tuesday, Friday and Saturday from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. The town has also placed links on its website (harpswell.maine.gov) to the state Centers for Disease Control (maine.gov/dhhs/mecdc/infectious-disease/epi/airborne/coronavirus.shtml), where the latest statewide information on the virus is available. 
     Your volunteer first responders from the Orr’s and Bailey Islands Fire Department are implementing the department’s Infection Control Plan and responding to calls for help throughout our island community. 
     Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) is in demand and in short supply. OBIFD Fire Chief Ben Wallace Jr. has asked for donations from residents who might have a personal supply of approved, unused N95 respirators still in their boxes, or sealed hand sanitizer. Please email Christine.donovanhall@obifd.org, if you can make a potentially life-saving donation.
       As a reminder, Chief Wallace has announced:
•      Routine training is canceled for the rest of March. A decision on routine April training will be made as events dictate. 
•      Fire station access is now limited to first responders. Responders are encouraged not to be at stations unless on official business. The gym at the Orr’s Island Fire Station is closed.
•      Exposure on rescue calls will be reduced. One Emergency Medical Technician (EMT) will screen patients from a safe distance and determine the level of PPE required. Other responders will stand by outside and only essential personnel will assist where necessary and under the direction of the EMT.
•      If responders are not feeling well, they should not go to the station or respond to calls. 
•      The Orr’s Island Schoolhouse is closed at the present time. However, the kitchen at the schoolhouse will be available to Harpswell Aging at Home for preparation of meals to be picked up or delivered, according to OBIFD Board of Directors President Bob Garver.
•       Arthur Howe III, the Town’s Emergency Management Agent, may be contacted for further information.  Please call 207-833-5771, ext. 126 or email:  ahowe@town.harpswell.me.us
 
     Current public guidance is that if you think you might need to be screened for COVID-19, please to do not go to the doctor, clinic or hospital without first calling. For more information on what to do in case you think you need to get screened, please call 211, or call your primary care provider from home."

A few weeks ago I went into the studio with some ultra talented musicians, producers and friends, and recorded 10 of my favorite original acoustic songs in about 72 hours. This is one of my absolute favorites, and I hope you'll give it a watch / listen. 

Sea Level Stomp is all about celebrating a balance between acknowledgement of the reality of climate change as an existential threat to humanity, and maintaining the optimism and community to give us a fighting chance at doing something about it. 

I'm so grateful to all of the folks credited below, and to everybody who has supported my hobbyist music career to date for making this possible.

"🇮🇳🇮🇳 A quaint town of Sikkim, called Lachen, draws tourists each year for its snow-capped peaks and photographic views. As tourism in the town grows, so does the number of plastic water bottles left behind. 😱 
The plastic bottles leftover from tourists prompted the local community to introduce bamboo water bottles as their replacement and we’re absolutely loving this idea! 
Comment below if you’re ready to make the switch from plastic to bamboo! 🎋

"Are you causing climate change?

Even Americans with low carbon foot prints still produce around 8.5 metric tons of CO2 a year.

4 acres of forest land can absorb 10.4 metric tons of CO2 per year. For $69 you can rent, and preserve 4 acres of forest land for an entire year.  

Our company mission is to make America carbon negative.  

Reducing the CO2 emitted is important and necessary, but it’s not enough.  We have to remove CO2 from the atmosphere.

Scientists estimate that we can reduce the CO2 in the atmosphere by 2/3 if we:
1. Preserve the 3 trillion trees currently on the planet, and
2. Plant 1 trillion more trees

New tree planting is great, but it is extremely expensive and new trees will not reduce as much CO2 as will mature trees.  The first step is mature tree preservation, because it is the most economic way to reduce CO2.

Why rent? We estimate that it is 100 to 200 times less expensive to rent vs buying.  This allows us to preserve more trees and eliminate more CO2.

If you’re not a part of the solution, you’re a part of the problem.

Join the movement and go #co2negative today.

Will it on its own take care of climate change? No. It is crucial that we address greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels, but CO2 drawdown by perennial polycultures will provide a much-needed buffer in helping to keep our one Earth livable.”

By finding ways to speed up this process, this project has the potential to play an important future role in locking away carbon from the atmosphere.”

"As it is Skincare Awareness Month, we’re looking at how consumers are reacting to the rise of probiotic skincare products.⁣
⁣
As Vivienne Rudd from Mintel highlights, research back in 2018 illustrated that half of US women who use beauty products regard probiotic ingredients as healthy and 26% believed they are effective. However, just 9% said that probiotic ingredients improve their appearance. So why are we not yet linking probiotics with improved skin health?⁣
⁣
From research, it seems that we are all broadly aware of probiotics in connection with yogurt and drinks, such as Yakult, and we link them with gut health – so why not the skin?⁣
⁣
Focus groups have shown that Chinese women, who tend to follow a more rigorous skincare routine and are more knowledgeable about ingredients and formats, have more often heard of and tried probiotic skincare.⁣
⁣
One participant particularly appreciates the potential benefits: “There is a lot of pollution in Shanghai, so I am forced to wash and cleanse my skin when back home. These cosmetics would help restore the skin microbiome balance.”⁣
⁣
So, it seems that as people become more aware of probiotic skincare products and start to use them, there is a natural improvement in understanding and appreciation for them – we all just have to be keen to learn and teach others.⁣
⁣
For a full run-down of the ingredients have a peek out our ‘ingredients’ highlight and the full article is available on our website. Happy reading!⁣

"A statement seen today: ""Income inequality and climate change are the most important issues of our time""

No

The much more important issue is that humans as a whole have been relegated to slaves 25% to 50%, some places 70% of the year to pay for services with an average approval rating of less than 20%, the most powerful agencies with as low as 3%.  Our money is legally used to propagandize and polarize us all, in every one of 196 nation states. 196 is FAR TOO FEW to effectively manage that with which society tasks these strong-man groups across all nearly 8 billion people.  The task is too large and the scope too wide.  They pit neighbor on neighbor and use threats of theft, kidnap and imprisonment backed with the action of murder if you do not comply with their dictate.

Every. Single. One. All 196 do this to one degree or another.

They use proxy wars to limit supplies, reach and power of their claimed political enemies. They use propaganda to make us suspect the peoples of those nations as our enemy.  They steal from businesses to give to buddies in their geographic monopoly on force, then not only steal a portion of any sale between peoples of the ""opposing"" regions, they publicly claim they and only they made the business possible. 

They act no better than other gangs ""protecting"" territories and demanding payment from the residents. 

Income inequality stems from them.
Economic calamity stems from them
War stems from them
Poverty in cities stems from them
Most pollution is from them
Corruption, slander and grift are their trade, threats of murder, enslavement their tools.

"As the founder of this organization I have struggled over the past few weeks (but actually years) with how to articulate how I feel we have failed the young people in our lives. 

In the past few weeks I've gained a bit of clarity. That it's OK to both believe in them with all I have... and yet acknowledge that we failed them. On issues ranging from climate change and school shootings to racism and social justice. 

This article in yesterday's St. Louis Post comes close to my sentiments. I know our scholars and their friends and peers will make the most of this world we hand them because they, unlike us, have not yet given up on the idea that we can be better.

"As the smoke and pollution from wildfires in California spread as far as Pennsylvania, it is vitally important that Americans learn how to protect their lungs during wildfire season.

Here are some tips, as shared by the CDC:

1. Always stay on top of the AQI (air quality index) of your area. That way, you’ll know when you need to take precautions to keep your lungs safe.

2. Staying indoors is an essential step: protecting yourself from the air outdoors is the first step to making sure that the pollutants from wildfire smoke, such as carbon monoxide, do not affect you.

3. Try not to add to indoor pollution by doing things like lighting candles or smoking. In addition, only vacuum with HEPA vacuum, otherwise you will be spreading more pollution in your home.

4. When you do have to go outside, try to use an N95 or KN95 mask. Since N95s are relatively hard to come by, do your best to get the best quality mask you can to protect your lungs.

5. Especially if you suffer from any respiratory issues, make sure that you speak to your doctor about your sensitivities and how to stay safe.

6. While keeping your windows and doors closed helps, the best thing you can do for your home is to actively remove pollutants with a HEPA-quality air purifier. The pollutants in wildfire smoke are quite small, and thus require excellent filtration.

"As the world continues to seem be holding steady throughout the pandemic. We have in some areas  of the country gone about our lives not seeing the effects of our own reactions to the circumstances that we have caused in the country and around the world. 
California, Oregon, Washington and other western states are having to deal with some serious climate changes that we created eons ago. Now is the time to let God back in to our lives and into our homes. Stop leaving the creator out of the loop. He is the ONE who Created YOU, ME, and everything around us. He created the world in 7 days and everything in it and those upon it. Why can't we accept the fault that we are the ones who destroyed this world not GOD. 
Why don't we just take a minute and stand accountable and find the truths that are inside each and every one of us. We caused this problem not our Creator. Our Creator allowed us the freedom to do as we willed and now we see that we should have kept HIM in our lives daily and that we shouldn't have pushed HIM OUT. https://nyti.ms/35lrsSb

": ATTENTION HOME OWNERS:

Does your home have a smart digital meter?

If you have one, this is how your smart meter can help you save tens of thousands of dollars over the next 25+ year by generating your own power!

The secrets of PG&E:

The things everyone including myself wish they knew sooner!

For a limited time, homeowners with an existing digital smart meter can now offset their energy bills by generating their own power.

PG&E and other Utilities provides a  system called "" Net Metering"" (NEM) against electricity consumed at night, and other periods when the home's electricity use exceeds the production of system.

Customers are only billed for their ""net"" energy use.

In simple terms, you can use the energy produced during the day to power your homes at night!

Having Net Metering set in place is important  so it can balance future months where your system may not generate enough energy to cover your usage.

Super cool right ?!

I know!

With programs being reduced and local utilities rates increasing annually, going green should be a no-brainer after discovering how many tens of thousands of dollars you could save over the life of your system.

Maybe it's time for YOU to take another look at generating your own power!

 Here are some benefits:

Increase the value of the property!

Sell ​​your home faster!

Save a lot of money over the next 25+ years!

Help eliminate pollution by producing clean energy!

Help the environment!

Disclosure:

You MUST own the home you live in. There are other questions I will also need to ask over the phone to see if solar is a good fit for you and your family."

"Austin’s fragile local food ecosystem is crumbling. As the coronavirus crisis deepens, people ordering food for delivery - ingredients, kits, or prepared food - has gone up. But because services like Lettuce (www.lettuce.fm) and Farmance (www.farmance.com) have such little public awareness, most people are jumping to services that have spent billions in venture capital on marketing - you know, the Blue this, Hello that, something Fresh and what not. None of them are local, sustainable, zero-waste, or profitable. And, even if it’s us saying so, simply not as good! 

The sad result will be that the coronavirus will potentially create a whole new wave of unsustainable consumption - nutrient-deficient food flying long distances from factory farms, and enormous packaging waste 🤮 - fueling the other, potentially more devastating crisis staring at us - climate change.

While right here in Austin, our fragile local food ecosystem is at the cusp of devastation. With restaurants cutting back or closing abruptly, our entire supply chain - farmers, ranchers & distributors are hurting big time and some may not survive this crisis. They are looking at direct to consumer services like Lettuce and Farmance for respite. Otherwise, Big Ag(riculture) will win, again. :( 

We don’t have the millions in venture capital to counter this. But we have you! If you believe in what we stand for, please help us by taking a moment to spread the word by sharing this post, and telling your neighbors in Austin about us on www.Nextdoor.com and beyond. 

Thank you. 💚❤️"

"A water analyst plays an integral role in keeping drinking water for both humans and animals safe from bacteria and other contaminants. Due to a rise in pollution, this career is extremely important for maintaining public health.
Some typical responsibilities of a water analyst include collecting water samples, Visiting homes, performing testing on samples, documenting results, cleaning equipment and keeping track of inventory, educates customers and help them taking the best decision.
Collecting water samples from a variety of sources is necessary before any testing can be done. For this, a water analyst will go to Deferent homes in houston area such as residential, industrial or commercial to take a sample to bring back to a laboratory.
After collecting a sample, a water analyst will perform a series of tests on it. The essential goal of testing is to determine the quality of water and how much pollution it contains, Also give the client the solution for the growing up problem that the city is facing.

"Bakersfield is the most contaminated city in the US !
But you can help to change that. We only need 10 volunteers to help us clean the air of Bakersfield !

Preferably, schools, churches, industrial parks, and so on.
 
The American Lung Association has classified Bakersfield, California, as the city with the most contaminated air in the nation.(http://www.stateoftheair.org/city-rankings/most-polluted-cities.html)

As you know air pollution is the cause of many illnesses and unnecessary deaths. Deaths by breathing...

The non-profit association Urban Lung would like to change that by cleaning the ambient air of Bakersfield!
 
To do it we need the help of only 10 property owner's in Bakersfield, who would like to participate in Urban Lung´s drive to clean the air in your city, by hosting for a year one of our patented air purifiers on your property.

It is completely free! And you have to do nothing but agree to allow us to place one of our Kinetic Lungs on any spot of your property that receives the sun. 

Look at what we have achieved in Mexicali, BC, which was considered one of the the most contaminated cities in Mexico until 2019 ( www.urbanlung.com )

These are the written testimonies of some of the schools and churches in Mexicali which have hosted a Kinetic Lung on their property:

https://pulmonurbano.com/index.php/mexicali/111-testimonios-de-escuelas
 
One year after we installed our network of Kinetic Lungs, we've reduced the contamination in Mexicali from 87% of the time, to only 18.2% (Source: the Mexican Federal Agency of clean air SINAICA)
 
Just as in Mexicali a year ago, Bakersfield today is the number one in particle pollution!

Our patented system (US Patent 10406466) is the most advanced air purifier in the world. It is the fist technology that purifies the ambient air without filters of any type that contaminate the land, and without generating any gases that contaminate the air: the Kinetic Lung uses only ecological means to capture toxic particles and gasses. 

We use solar energy to power the ventilators that circulate 50 thousand cubic METERS of air in a single 12 hour day with each Kinetic Lung, (yes, that is 1,765,733 cubic feet per day and per Lung!) and we use kinetic energy to purify the air inside each cell.
 
As a reference, the kinetic energy is the same one that allows planes to fly.
 
The Kinetic Lung is completely autonomous and safe. It is almost completely quiet, and it doesn't require any activity from the hosts. We do the periodic maintenance and take care of everything, so the hosts don't have to worry about anything.

"BAREFOOT: THE MARK BAUMER DOCUMENTARY
From award-winning filmmaker Julie Sokolow comes this loving portrait of Mark Baumer, an environmental activist, avant-garde writer, and vegan, who hiked barefoot for over 100 days through America to draw attention to climate change. In a voice The New Yorker praised as “reminiscent of Andy Kaufman”, Baumer narrates his offbeat take on life and how we all can make a difference. Skillfully edited from Baumer’s own self-recorded videos, along with interviews from family and friends, it’s a moving portrait filled with laughs, tragedy, and inspiration. A movie about a man who loved life, loved the world, and it showed in everything he did.

"Because of COVID-19 we all held a breath in so that mother nature in turn could finally take one in. We stopped suffocating her with our pollutants, and in turn she exhaled a breath of fresh air. She once again shows herself to us. 
Everyday our planes don’t fly. Our buildings have stopped construction. We don’t consume as much. We don’t pollute as much. We as a people have had to limit ourselves and our pollution heavy activities because of the policies surrounding this pandemic.

"Best Selling Shell Hyacinth Straw Bag, with Blush Tassels - Back in Stock!

Artisans communities in Central Java collect the Water Hyacinth leaves. Water Hyacinth is a type of riverbank weeds that grow very quickly and often cause flood. To prevent flood, people used to harvest these plants and burn them, causing massive air pollutions. It's so amazing that today, our artisan communities can work together to harvest them and turn them into beautiful bags and even furnitures that has new valuable purposes.

"Boomers and Millennials – saving the world

I am a boomer, I know there are a many of my contemporaries who are struggling with physical disabilities, with age slowly shrinking our world and others who struggle every day with conditions such as depression and dementia.  We grew up during the Cold War where we were taught, Socialism leads to Communism – Better dead then Red.

It is only recently that it dawned on me that there is something that Boomers like me share with younger generations. We are losing or have lost agency[1] in our lives. The debt and poor prospect Millennials[2] are facing are as incapacitating in their own way as my old age. How can we maintain agency in the face of these challenges.  

To Millennials socialism means universal health care, child care and free college like many prosperous European countries, they didn't grow up with the Cold War and the threat of Nuclear Mutual Annihilation.  For them the problem is run away capitalism not creeping socialism that has had the worst effect on their lives.  Millennials came of age during the 2008 financial crisis.  They are burdened by college debt and they can not afford many of the things that their parents took for granted like owning homes or cars.

My generation had time, now we are out of time. I thought that I used my personal allotment of time wisely, trying to make the world a better place[3], after all apartheid[4] is just a memory.  But I never confronted the time horizon and that changes everything, not my personal time line but that of the planet we call home.

The current generation of progressives are out of time. You must act now.  So here is the bottom line.  You have been given a truly epic task.  One you never asked for.  All you have to do is save the world.  You are confronting a climate crisis that will leave many parts of the world uninhabitable for your children.  Millenials are not looking for Socialists, they are looking for politicians that address their problems, the affordability crisis in housing, health care, child care, college tuition and environmental collapse.

The US government used to be ambitious in solving social problems  - progressives started the minimum wage, income tax and ended child labor.  FDR started Social Security and put millions to work building roads, bridges, dams and schools as part of the New Deal.  LBJ enacted Medicare for the elderly, Medicaid for the poor and Voting Rights for all Americans.

I can understand why inheriting this task of saving the world might reduce your sense of agency and make you bitter about your plight. You are in a truly unique position at a horrible moment in human history. I believe the first step forward from here is to find a sense of agency, to take back control of your own life.

Boomers are, after all, the ones with the life experience to be able to help:  
 Helping doesn’t mean lecturing. 
 Helping doesn’t mean directing. 
Helping does mean: 
 Showing up and following 
 Supporting and caring 
 Listening and motivating. 
Basically, getting off our old butts.

Millennials don’t need parents now they need partners. Partners who can show them how to develop their own agency so they can save the world.  Millennials, you are not in this alone.

Jim Myres, OFS

Note:  Concepts and some text taken from  Nonlinear  Wednesday February 12, 2020 

1 - Agency is the sense of control that you feel in your life, your capacity to influence your own thoughts and behavior, and have faith in your ability to handle a wide range of tasks and situations. Your sense of agency helps you to be psychologically stable, yet flexible in the face of conflict or change
2 - Millennials, were born between 1980 and 1994. They are currently between 25-39 years old 
3 - (make the world a better place) Boomers, the generation with the most experience and longest track record in disciplined, well-organized, high-achievement in civil rights, human rights, women’s rights, environmentalism, and peace-work, the generations of  post world war II who built on the groundwork inspired by Mohandas Gandhi (1869 – 1948), Nelson Mandela (1918 - 2013), Desmond Tutu (1931 - ) and Martin Luther King Jr. (1929 - 1968) creating virtually the entire concept of grassroots nonviolent mass movements for democratic and social change.
4 - Apartheid was a system of institutional racial segregation that existed in South Africa and South West Africa (now Namibia) from 1948 until the early 1990s."
"Boonaa Mohammed witnesses the grim reality of lack of access to clean water when he visits a lake which has been dried up for over 10 years in the Harar region of Ethiopia.

Although essential for daily life and health, access to clean water is not always a simple proposition for families and communities in the Horn of Africa region (East Africa). In many parts of the region, the lack of adequate infrastructure to meet sustainable water solutions has caused much suffering, not to mention the ongoing cycle of drought and flooding caused by the effects of climate change.

"BREATH AND THE ASPHYXIATING LIFE IN TIME
(English)
I wonder if some of the most severe symptoms of corona-virus, such as difficulty breathing and low oxygen levels in the bloodstream, could point, from a psychological perspective, to a concomitant problem in our civilization. The manner in which we are living life is asphyxiating. From the perspective of the collective unconscious, societies and its members are increasingly distanced from their instinctual roots. Across the world, people live a one-sided life that emphasizes intellectualism and that fosters a disconnection from their inner life, especially from the body and its animal roots. It seems as if people may be unconsciously asphyxiating their own psychological life and life in Nature. Both the denial of current Climate Crisis and the high levels of psychological suffering around the world may attest to that. Nature and the inner nature have little room to breath, and their revenge is the creation of an asphyxiating disease in humans.
I wonder what would happen if we stop asphyxiating our inner live and Nature and give them enough space to breath.....and live more fully."

"California's agriculture accounts for only 3% of the state's economic production but consumes 85% of the water withdrawn.⠀
⠀
The practice of applying about 10 million L irrigation water per ha each year results in approximately 5 t salts per ha being added to the soil. The salt deposits can be flushed away with added fresh water, but at a significant cost. The amount of world agricultural land destroyed by salinized soil each year is estimated to be 10 million ha.⠀
⠀
Because more than 99% of the world's food comes from the land, an adequate global food supply depends on the continued availability of productive soils. Erosion adversely affects crop productivity by reducing the availability of water; by diminishing soil nutrients, soil biota, and soil organic matter; and by decreasing soil depth. The reduction in the amount of water available to growing plants is considered the most harmful effect of erosion, because eroded soil absorbs 87% less water through infiltration than uneroded soil. Soybeans and oats intercept approximately 10% of the rainfall in areas where they are planted, whereas tree canopies intercept 15% to 35%. Thus, the removal of trees increases water runoff and reduces water availability.⠀
⠀
Increasing soil organic matter by applying manure or similar materials can improve the water infiltration rate by as much as 150%. In addition, the use of vegetative cover, such as grass strips, and intercropping help slow both water runoff and erosion. For example, when silage corn is interplanted with red clover, water runoff can be reduced by as much as 87%, and soil loss can be reduced by 78%. Reducing water runoff in these and other ways is an important step in increasing water availability to crops, conserving water resources, decreasing nonpoint-source pollution, and ultimately decreasing water shortages.⠀

"Calling Faith Leaders and Faith Based Climate Advocates

I am writing to invite you to an important event, the inaugural Greater New Orleans Climate Justice & Creation Care Prayer Brunch. Please see graphic below, also attached as a PDF suitable for printing. 

This is for all faith and lay leaders and frontline volunteers. It is nothing less than a call to protect all children of the Earth from the climate crisis. Pastor Gregory Manning (Broadmoor Community Church) and a small group of others are launching what we hope will be an enduring and transformative coalition of faith-based community leaders working for climate justice and the greening of our communities. 

At this event you will learn vital information from top faith based climate justice and creation care advocates including:
1. What innovative faith communities are doing to educate their members and green their faith communities
2. The science and faith basis behind climate justice and creation care
3. New Orleans decision-making on embracing a commitment to carbon-free renewable energy
4. How pollution is both warming the earth and sickening and causing the death of our most vulnerable neighbors
5. Faith-based organizing for climate justice and creation care
6. Legal and legislative advocacy for a clean and safe environment

People of all faiths are welcome. This particularly includes traditions and communities who are sometimes forgotten or even excluded from local interfaith initiatives. 

If you are interested in attending, please register by the 29th of February so we can provide (vegetarian) food for all. 

Here's the link to register: 
https://tiny.cc/climateprayerbrunch

Moreover, we are asking for your help to spread the word! Please forward and share as appropriate, and post to your Facebook and web pages. Please let me know if you have questions.

YES, yes you can. 💕 Our own actions affect the planet. And personal initiatives to fight climate change, when multiplied, carry the potential to have a significant ripple effect.⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Tag a friend and share something you did today to reduce waste or your impact on the planet. 👋⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
We’ve seen an incredible turn out at the Climate Strikes and I've been noticing more and more people not only knowing what ""zero waste"" means, but actively working towards it.⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀

"Capitalism is a clockwork contrivance causing cataclysmic climate change, plus it produces poverty and pain and perceptions of powerlessness in people. We must insist on the path of most resistance; we will respect existence or face extinction."
"Captain William Hall was a shipbuilder from Maine who  purchased the four shipyards active here in the mid-19th century and combined them. In 1856, he built this Gothic-Italianate home across from his shipyard. That same year, his company finished the 'Charles Cooper,' a packet ship that ran between New York and Antwerp. A century later, it was almost purchased by the South Street Seaport for exhibition as the only surviving ship of its kind. The ship was deemed too fragile for transport and it remains on display in the Falkland Islands. .
In 1981, the FBI raided the home and confiscated money, drugs, and jewelry. They alleged that Melody Law was operating a prostitution ring here under the guise of Executive Services, Inc. A federal prosecutor had hoped Ms. Law would cooperate in a probe of corruption in Bridgeport and its police department. She refused and received a three-year prison sentence and a $20,000 fine. .
During the case, charges were made that a bordello was run out of this house with services provided locally and in other states and Caribbean islands. Ms. Law was accused of putting on a sex show for a ""platoon"" of Bridgeport police officers, with one ""winning"" one of the madame's women in a raffle. One detective was said to lived here while another gave Ms. Law a gun permit in exchange for services here. They were also said to tip her off to any pending police crackdowns.
. 
Police Superintendent Joseph Walsh denied the allegations against members of his force and said Ms. Law was actually an informant, a claim she denied. A year earlier the FBI had hoped to ensnare Walsh in a bribery scandal, but he turned the tables on the sting and arrested the operative, a local car thief. Walsh likened the feds' actions to the Katzenjammer Kids while national coverage said their efforts were reminiscent of the Keystone Cops. .
Ms. Law's attorney was Raymond W. Ganim. His nephew is the city's current mayor. The younger Ganim was re-elected after serving a 7-year prison term for bribery, extortion, and racketeering during five terms as mayor, as investigated by the FBI."

"CASLC is honored to present guest speaker Cris Costello, Senior Organizing Manager for the Sierra Club Our Wild Florida Campaign, who will update us on the No Roads to Ruins Campaign to stop M-CORES

You Must Register in Advance!  After registration a link to access the meeting will be sent to you.  Space is limited!

About M-CORES
In 2019, the Florida legislature passed a bill to create 330 miles of new toll roads (M-CORES). These roads will cut through environmentally sensitive land, including the watersheds of some of Florida’s most treasured springs.  They threaten water quality and state parks and preserves all along the proposed routes.  

About Cris Costello  
Cris has been organizing the grassroots for the Sierra Club since May 2007 and since 2017 has been the Senior Organizing Manager for the Sierra Club Our Wild Florida Campaign, which encompasses the Everglades Restoration, Red Tide, Stop Sugar Field Burning, and Wildlands campaigns.

Cris coordinates the Sierra Club’s statewide water quality campaign to prevent harmful algal blooms in both coastal and inland waters in Florida by eliminating point and non-point sources of fertilizer, sewage and animal manure pollution.  She works with partner environmental and civic organizations, local government staff and officials, homeowner associations, and landscape maintenance professionals around the following issues:  Everglades restoration, springs protection, local and state-level urban fertilizer management policy, water quality standards for Florida’s fresh and estuarine waters, wildlife habitat protection, and the acquisition of conservation land.  From day one, urban fertilizer ordinance adoption has been an important part of her work; as of March 15, 2020, thirteen (13) counties and one-hundred plus (100+) municipalities have adopted strict rainy season application bans on Nitrogen and Phosphorus urban fertilizer.

In 2019, with the passage of a bill to create 330 miles of new toll roads (M-CORES), Cris turned her attention to building a state-wide coalition to stop the proposed tollways in their tracks; the No Roads to Ruin Coalition, as of June 1, 2020, had ninety one (91) coalition members focused on mobilizing the overwhelming public opposition to the new roads. 

CASLC is a member of the No Roads to Ruin Coalition."

"—> Children of Water <—

As the ultimate life source, water is our mother and we are its children.

When we asked Claudia Schmitt from @thejetlagged that ‘How do you relate to water?’, her answer was – “Our planet is the only place in the known universe confirmed to host life. And every lifeform on Earth has one thing in common: it needs water to live. Nothing on our planet can survive without water. The ocean covers 71% (and rising) of the Earth’s surface and contains 97% of its water. When you don’t snorkel or dive, you’re missing out on over two-thirds of our planet! Under the surface, we discover a world filled with incredible underwater gardens and almost magical creatures. From the tiniest bioluminescent plankton, which produces most of the oxygen in our atmosphere, to the largest animal on this planet, the blue whale - the ocean is our planet's life-support system.

We further asked, ‘What do you do to protect water?’ she explained that “We are filmmakers specializing in underwater and conservation documentaries. Scuba divers are often closest to the change happening in the sea. We’ve seen coral bleaching, plastic pollution and the effects of overfishing with our own eyes. We use our cameras to raise awareness about the fragility of the ocean and its importance for our planet. It has become our commitment to protect the ocean and everything that lives in it. We don’t eat fish, we avoid single-use plastic/microplastics and only use reef-safe sunscreen. For our job, we have to fly a lot, but apart from that, we’re reducing our carbon footprint as much as we can. We raise our voice for the ocean wherever and whenever we can. We need to push for action NOW, to protect the ocean as if our lives depend on it - because in fact they do!”

Thank you Claudia from @thejetlagged for this beautiful submission.🌊🐳🐬

"Climate Change - Social Change and The Next 50 Years of Coastal Protection

Special guest Dr. Charles Lester
Director Ocean and Coastal Policy Center, Marine Science Institute, University of California Santa Barbara

THURSDAY, AUG. 20, 2020, 6:30PM

Please register in advance for this meeting:
https://us02web.zoom.us/j/89778114785
After registering, you will receive a confirmation email containing information about joining the meeting.

The passage of California's Proposition 20 Coastal Initiative in 1972 launched perhaps the greatest coastal protection experiment ever. California has since become an international leader in coastal management, with a vision to protect the coast for present and future generations while providing for its sustainable development. By most accounts, California's coastal protection effort has been a huge success. Yet today, the state faces an ever-growing set of challenges, from sea level rise, to insidious plastic pollution, to the wide-spread gentrification of the coastal zone. Questions are squarely raised: has California's coastal management experiment achieved its original vision?  Is the state of the coast after 50 years of considered management a cause for celebration, or is it time to take stock, diagnose, and re-tool for the next 50 years?  Dr. Lester, former Executive Director of the California Coastal Commission and Director of the relaunching Ocean and Coastal Policy Center at the Marine Science Institute at UCSB will reflect on the last fifty years of California coastal management, and discuss some of the core challenges facing the state."

  This virus still dominates the legacy media, but it is not news. It is all ill informed opinion. I don’t care how many people test positive. Stop this silly testing and the numbers go down. Test those working with the vulnerable. For the rest, fugetaboutit! Even the numbers in hospital doesn’t mean much, as many hospitals almost went bankrupt during lockdown. It really is the numbers in ICU and the numbers who have died. Even that is not accurate. Did they die with the virus or of the virus? If you are 90 years old did the virus make that much difference? Just asking?
  Initial data suggested 3% mortality so panic and lockdown. Lockdown was a communist China thing, never done before in the world’s history. Totally unprecedented and not based on any science, just on these silly computer models, based on lousy data, like the global warming scam. In the medical profession we thought this was the big one and many of us would die. Looking back at my posts, by the middle of April, believable figures from Germany suggested 0.3% mortality. If true, meant lockdown not required. 
  The legacy media was useless. They exaggerated everything. Sweden never lockdown. Media kept saying Sweden would burst into flames. Never did! Swedes feel they could have better protected their ill elderly in nursing homes. But the ill elderly are going to die anyway. Think Shakespeare’s Macbeth, ‘tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow creeps on this petty pace from day to day.’ I wrote that dying alone on a ventilator was maybe not the preferred way to leave this world. The world has changed. When I was a medical student 50 years ago, I was taught that pneumonia was ‘the old man’s friend.’ 
  And children very seldom got really sick. In Canada 1 child under 19 years of age has died and there are no details. They didn’t transmit to adults. So closing schools and playgrounds made no sense. Getting data was so difficult. The young NY doc who pointed out that CPAP was better than ventilations was fired. The 2 California docs who pointed out lockdown was silly were shut down. I knew the reported US death rates were totally untrue, but there were no accurate figures.
 I was starting to feel like a lone voice crying in the wilderness. Finally heard an interview on ‘Uncommon Knowledge’, with clever doc. He confirmed everything I thought. Listen to the interview yourself. I believe it to be the truth, and let’s stop this futile lockdown."

"Computer models will be the death of us

It’s very likely that you have heard the old saying, “garbage in and garbage out” when it comes to computers. I think this description is perfectly appropriate when it comes to computer models, but, I prefer to put it I think in a much better way….”computers only know what they are told to know.” 

There are a great number of assumptions that go into computer models, and by making only minor adjustments to those assumptions the outcome can be greatly changed. The problem with these assumptions is that they are moving targets and it can never be known which target to move where in order to create what is to be the likely outcome. Computer models can be used for an attempt at genuine informative purposes as with the Chinese Flu or they can be used for corrupt purposes as with climate change.

The recent talk of how computer models have wildly exaggerated the number of projected infections, deaths, and needs arising from the Chinese Flu is troubling, but not at all surprising if you have been following the climate modeling debacle. I have no doubt that those creating the models in order to attempt to predict how the Chinese Flu will progress are doing it with good intentions. However, good intentions don’t cut it. If I attempt to give you a free haircut and cut your ear off in the process, I don’t think you will give me credit for trying to be a good ol’ boy. 

With the Chinese Flu, modelers have no clue what we are dealing with right now, because it is simply too new, unknown, and chaotic. Besides, we don’t really know how long its been in the United States. I think its been around a lot longer than generally thought, because we don’t know how long China had been hiding it from the rest of the world. 

These models are being created using faulty assumptions that are doing nothing but scaring the hell out of everyone, including policy makers which then can lead to bad policy. Computer models are not science nor are they data. Policies should be created using facts and data only, not suppositions. We need to stop playing Nostradamus and knock it off with the modeling, and deal with this issue by figuring out what works, by using real data and facts as we learn them. 

The climate models are where we get into corruption, because they are political tools. Climate models are intentionally used to scare the hell out of everyone in order to further the agenda of the climate jihadists. It’s a form of appeal to authority, and it’s an ages old tactic that the meek have allowed to be used against themselves by those in power in order to appropriate their freedoms. 

Trying to model the Chinese Flu is impossible enough, but trying to model the climate is even more impossible, if that’s possible. Climate is a system of complete chaos and is affected by the oceans, the atmosphere, forces outside the Earth’s atmosphere, by activity within the Earth, and all of which occur on different and varying timescales.

Computer models are nice toys and fun to play with, but should never be used for policy decisions. The notion that a mathematical formula can be created to predict the future of a chaotic system is an act of utter futility in the case of the Chinese Flu, and utter corruption in the case of climate change. There probably has always existed in the human condition the desire to predict the future. I think we are better off influencing the future, and leaving the predicting to the guys wearing the sandwich boards where the appeal to authority does not apply."

"COPIED & PASTED 
Dear Gavin Newsom 
As you sat on this person's property and held your very, set up press conference, with these professional photos, our town is suffering. As you discuss global warming you left out how many lost their fire insurance, or are paying astronomical rates for mediocre coverage. My insurance was canceled. I had to fight to find coverage and make adjustments. Not everyone can do that. People have nothing. 

You didnt come into our community, speak to our business owners, instead you threw a tantrum and insisted we close indoor dining or lose funding. You do realize some of our friends were sleeping in cars? Would you prefer to feed your scared children in a car or in the familiar warmth of a local restaurant filled with friendly faces?
As you sat there in your luxury brand distressed clothing for this photo, I'm sure this was your campaign managers idea in an attempt to connect with us you completely disregarded our local media, bringing the sacbee to support your own agenda, heaven forbid you get asked the ""real questions"". You didnt visit our first responders, break bread with them, sit on the concrete while they take a 15 min nap. 
Did you stop by any of our disaster relief centers?
Wow what a photo that would had been, you getting your hands dirty SERVING our community. Once your agenda was fulfilled and photos were taken you were gone. I especially love your smoked filled images based in San Francisco, displaying the suffering because those are the idiots who vote for you. We are so sorry our smoke is an inconvenience. 
You sir are a disgrace. You have one agenda and we're done!

"County Executive Alsobrooks held a conference call with elected officials from throughout the County tonight, and I want to share a few highlights.
 
The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Prince George’s County is 53, as of 3/22/20, and we can expect that number to continue to rise as more testing becomes available. People who have tested positive are spread throughout the County, with at least one case in every municipality. Further, it is clear that there are many people who have been exposed to the virus who have not started to manifest symptoms.
 
In order to decrease the numbers of people affected at one time, which is what overwhelms healthcare systems, it can’t be emphasized enough how critically important it is to practice “social distancing,” meaning to limit your in-person contact with people, and at all times to maintain at least a 6-foot distance with anyone you don’t live with. Staying home is our best defense. Each of us must and can do our part. It is difficult to say how long this will continue, but know that it will be for longer than two weeks.
 
The Bus has reduced service, effective Monday, March 23, 2020, to the following routes: 11, 12, 14, 15x, 23, 27 and 34, in addition to the bus lines already suspended (routes 21x, 22, 25, 35s, 51 and 53). Remaining routes will operate on a regular schedule until further notice. No fare will be collected during this time.
Prince George’s County Public Schools completed the cleaning and disinfection of all its schools and buses this weekend.
FedEx Field is being prepared to be an assessment and testing site.
We have been told that we will be receiving additional test kits soon. It was shared with us that as of now, priority will be given to long-term care facilities, medical providers, and first responders. If you have any questions or concerns about COVID-19 and testing, please call the Prince George’s County Health Department Coronavirus hotline at (301)883-6627 from 8:00 am - 8:00 pm. *Please contact 911 for medical emergencies only. Do not contact 911 for Coronavirus related issues.
Prince George’s Police are taking reports on the phone for non-violent crimes.
The Department of Corrections stopped in-person visitation almost 2 weeks ago. They are planning to allow each inmate to have 3 free calls home every day.  
Regular trash, recycling, and yard waste pickup are continuing as scheduled. Bulky trash pick-up has been suspended for the time being. The landfill is open to the public. For more information visit h.ere https://www.princegeorgescountymd.gov/615/Brown-Station-Road-Sanitary-LandfillEmploy Prince George’s can assist with unemployment applications. For more information visit https://www.employpg.org/
The Department of Permitting, Inspections, and Enforcement will function remotely, delivering services online. 
Customers who are unable to use online services will have access to a drop-box available at the building to drop off plans and payments. The Department will continue to inspect construction and properties.
The Board of License Commissioners is still operating. Liquor board applications will be accepted in a dropbox and inspections will continue. For more information, please contact 301-583-9980.
Community Legal Services staff are working remotely, but are still assisting with civil (not criminal) legal questions involving family law, domestic violence, and landlord and tenant conflicts. Their services are available online or via their hotline at 240-391-6370.
The Family Justice Center building is currently closed however, services will still be available via telephone during normal business hours - Monday through Friday from 8:30 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. For further assistance, please call (301)780-8008, and an Intake Specialist will follow up with you. IF YOU ARE IN IMMEDIATE DANGER, PLEASE CALL 911.
 
This is a constantly evolving situation and I will do my best to update the community with information as I receive it. We will get through this challenging time together.

"Creating awareness on the benefits of recycling! We undertake clean up campaigns with the sole aim of eradicating plastic pollution and creating awareness on the benefits of recycling! Join us at our next Campaign Trail!"
"Creation Art Center and Miami Hispanic Cultural Arts Center ""Closed: SOS Mother Earth"" collective virtual art exhibit continues with artist @Mikey Adams ""Message from an Island""
Michael Adams (USA) is a sustainable development graduate from the University of Florida who is passionate about raising awareness about environmental issues such as plastic pollution and climate change. He has professional experience in renewable energy, including internships related to the future of the solar energy market and innovative methods to convert waste to bio-methane energy.
He volunteers his time with local NGO’s such as The CLEO Institute and Sendit4thesea, and is committed to working on projects dedicated to the creation of a more sustainable future.
“Rising Seas: the endangered islands of Guna Yala” is a project by Adams to raise awareness about climate change and the threat it represents to indigenous islands.
Guna Yala, also known as “the San Blas islands”, is located on the northeast coast of Panama. It is an autonomous region, encompassing 4,668 square miles of continental forest and coastline, and an archipelago of 365 coral islands with a population of approximately 40,000 people.
Michael Adams has collected in photographs and in a documentary the images of one of the islands, which is estimated could disappear (or, at least, its people) and the stories that the locals tell about islands that have already disappeared. Indigenous people wonder how their community and culture will affect what they are experiencing.
Carti Sugdup Island, full of houses on the water's edge, will soon not be so populated. Some 300 families are migrating to the continent due to the impact of climate change. Every year, the sea level rises a few millimeters, eroding the valuable living space. To defend against the rising sea, residents build barriers from coral rocks dug into the sea, but it is only a temporary band-aid and damages the local marine ecosystem."

"Dear Elected Representatives of Yonkers,

I am writing to express my opposition to the proposed UPS facility at 555 Tuckahoe Road in Yonkers. My mother-in-law raised seven children in this home and the activity at that facility, if allowed to proceed, will destroy the quality of life for her and the entire neighborhood and will also lower property values of the immediate neighborhood. Why aren't our elected representatives preventing this degradation of Yonkers life from happening?

There will be 42 semi trailers coming into that property every day beginning at 3 AM and nearly 150 UPS trucks. What about the air quality for the neighborhood? Will UPS be providing them with personal protective equipment? Will the city of Yonkers bear the financial cost of additional ailments due to poor air quality?

I don’t believe that gas tanks holding thousands of gallons of gasoline—either above ground or below ground—are permitted in the CM zoning where the facility is located. I would like to hear from the Planning Board the definitive answer on that particular question, and must ask why our elected representatives are not asking such questions themselves. UPS has been deceptive on the number of parking spaces they are adding, saying at times 524 but pointing out a 100-space lot and a 142-space lot. Again I would like to hear from the Planning Board what they believe the exact number of parking spots that will be created and, again, must ask why our elected representatives are not asking such questions on behalf of the neighborhood.

According to the presentation, UPS actually hopes to ELIMINATE JOBS by establishing this facility. Specifically, they hope to eliminate 15 drivers (see page 7). The evidence suggests that UPS hopes to displace older, run-down facilities (in Elmsford and the Bronx, for example). It appears UPS would remove all the green space that remains to add parking spaces (see page 10). At a meeting of the Yonkers Planning Commission on July 9, 2014, the facility’s property owners (who still own the property) confirmed their commitment, as a condition to build the Hampton Inn, that they will never develop the remaining green space. Again I would like to hear from the Planning Board (some of whom were members at that time) why they are not requiring the property owner to honor that commitment, and again must ask why our elected representatives are not protecting their constituents by blocking this development.

The plan also calls for a middle turn lane added on Tuckahoe Road. This will especially have an impact on Grassy Sprain Village. The additional traffic will cause traffic tie-ups on Tuckahoe Road between two street lights that are one city block long apart. Has the Yonkers Fire Department been asked to look at this plan and, if not, why haven't their advice and consent been sought?

Such an expansion as this would normally require an Environmental Impact Report under the circumstances. Why is the planning board approving this without requiring an environmental impact report? The activity of 42 tractor trailers/day beginning at 3am, and 225 UPS package trucks throughout the day will have a huge impact on traffic safety. And the belief that a ""sound wall"" will mitigate the noise is downright laughable—it will be as effective against sound and pollution as it would be against a virus. Again, why isn't an Environmental Impact Report being requested? What about the air quality of the neighborhood?

There are many other reasons I oppose this development, and I believe the majority of residents also oppose this development. It is a sad state affairs that the government and the Board is steamrolling this development through without giving the neighbors the proper opportunity to respond."
"Dear Friends,
Please join us for the premiere of 'TRANS PECOS' |
The Story of Stolen Land and the
Loss of America’s Last Frontier

Sunday, February 23rd
at the Stateside Theater
in Austin, TX

This documentary sets out to uncover the truth of the controversial Trans Pecos Pipeline while creating a poetic portrait of Far West Texas and the American people whose lives and land the pipeline has affected. The story is woven of a diverse fabric of an insider, landowners, concerned citizens of different colors, classes and creeds - some of which come from the oil and gas industry itself.

TRANS PECOS is a story about the unexpected bipartisan alliances that occur when companies place private gain before public good.

The grassroots support behind TRANS PECOS attempts to find common ground in a way that strengthens citizen engagement and civic bridges.
It is a story of how one natural gas pipeline in Far West Texas can act as a conduit of change between informed citizens and those in power as the future of natural resources and energy is decided.

Stay tuned in the coming days for ticket info."

"Dear TCBM Customers ~ A new NY State law is taking effect March 1, 2020 banning plastic carryout grocery bags.  The “Bag Waste Reduction Law” is to help prevent pollution in our communities.  Therefore, TCBM will no longer have plastic grocery carryout bags.  While stores are not required to have bags available to customers, we cannot imagine not accommodating our customers.  Below is information regarding availability of bags at TCBM once this new law takes effect.

1.  We will have sturdy reusable bags w/handles available for purchase at a minimal cost to our customers located at our registers.
2.  We will have paper bags available.
3.  We encourage customers to become accustom to using reusable bags.  
4.  Customers may use any type of clean reusable bag such as one made of cloth.  It should be washable & designed for multiple uses. 
5.  If a customer has a small purchase and does not want a bag, let the cashier know, this too will be a great help.  
If you choose to bring your own bag/bags, “BYOB” remember to try and make a habit of bringing your bags into the store when you arrive.  When it’s time to check out, hand the cashier your bag/bags.  After the cashier is done ringing your order, they will place your items in your bags.  
Change is not always easy or even welcomed but we hope over times everyone becomes use to this new procedure.  Please SHARE this information with your friends, thank you. 🌲🌳 https://www.dec.ny.gov/chemical/50034.html"

"Did you know indoor air spaces are 2 to 5 times more contaminated than outdoor air?

Air pollution affects our lungs insidiously, indirectly, gradually. But its effects are equally horrific, the morbidity and mortality of the diseases it triggers much higher. 

In fact, even when it doesn’t actually trigger disease, air pollution ends up compromising and weakening the human lungs, making us more vulnerable to respiratory viruses.

Factories (especially those living in SACRIFICE ZONES), power plants, transportation (air contamination is 9 to 12 times higher inside the car than outside) and agriculture (Those who live on and nearby farms) are substantial contributors to reduced air quality!

One way to alleviate air pollution minimizing inhalation of contaminated air is to use air purifiers like our Mobile Personal Ionizing Air Purifier that produces negatively charged molecules called ions to clean air around you.

Air purifiers are known to remove up to 99.97% of pollutants in the air with many benefits. They provide high air quality around you by lessening exposure to pollutants and harmful chemicals and helps you enjoy good health

Are you going to join countless consumers using air purifiers to minimize inhalation of contaminated air and particles?

We are offering FREE shipping and if air pollution is a matter of interest, please a simple share, tag, or friendly comment will go a long way!

Our Goal at Zenlyf is to help people maintain their equilibrium! 

Minimizing Air Pollution is one way how we Maintain Our Equilibrium for maximum daily performance to reach our goals!

"#didyouknow Single-use plastics (aka disposable plastics) have an average lifespan of only 30 mins before they are tossed out or recycled? ⌛️ Since most of our food packaging are made of these plastics, it’s not surprising that food and drink packaging contributes to more than half of all plastic waste generated in Singapore. 🤢
‍‍‍‍‍‍ 
To exasperate matters, food waste is not recyclable; therefore, the additional effort required to thoroughly clean these plastic packaging often deters many individuals from recycling. 😥 
‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍ 
To address this issue, TRIA Sustainable Packaging—a sustainable packaging solutions firm—creates sustainable packaging made of plant-based bioactive polyester which can be digested along with food waste in the company’s Bio24 digestion system. Basically, the system takes breaks down both the package and the food waste and turns them into fertilizer!  🍖+🍤+🥡🔜🌱

"Did you know that the island nation of Kiribati exists within all 4 hemispheres of the World? Also, due to their time zone, Kiribati is first to celebrate the New Year every year! Located in the central Pacific Ocean, Kiribati is made up of 33 atolls and reef islands, only 21 of which are inhabited. Kiribati gained its independence from the United Kingdom, becoming a sovereign state in 1979.The bird on Kiribati’s flag is a frigate bird which represents power, freedom and Kiribati cultural dance patterns. The rising sun represents the tropical sun as Kiribati lies astride the Equator. The blue & white stripes represent the Pacific Ocean which surrounds Kiribati. On June 2008, Kiribati officials asked Australia and New Zealand to accept its citizens as permanent refugees. Kiribati is expected to be the first country to lose all its land territory to global warming.

"DOT TAG AWR 302 Pipeline Security in Rural Communities
to be held in West City, IL on March 7th, 2020 beginning at 8am.  

America’s pipeline system stretches across the country like the veins and arteries of the human body and much of this system crosses the rural environment. The pipeline system delivers two-thirds of the petroleum products and nearly all of the natural gas to the homes and businesses of the United States. The system includes 2.5 million miles of pipelines, operated by over three thousand companies. The pipelines carry not only petroleum products and natural gas but also other hazardous liquid materials. The purpose of this awareness level, instructor-led course is to bring together rural pipeline security stakeholders including public safety, oil and gas pipeline representatives (large and small), local emergency planners, pertinent federal agencies, and other community stakeholders to recognize pipeline security threats and identify mitigation strategies within their jurisdictions to ensure that the rural pipeline sector is secure, resilient.

The registration deadline is February 22nd, 2020 at 5pm. To register, visit the following link:

"Doug Reeves, PE

Doug grew up in Odessa.  He went to school here: Burnett Elementary, Nimitz Jr. High, and Permian High School where he graduated in 1977.

After some time in the cement plant near Penwell, then in the oil field as a wire-line operator and tubing tester, he joined the US Navy as a sonar technician.  He also worked with multiple fabricators and contractors.  He was the bridge crew foreman for a company in Florida where he installed conduit lines under bridge decks on the east coast for the fiber-optic cable industry.  He has worked alongside -and learned from- some of the best architects, geotechnical, forensic, civil, and structural engineers that the DFW area has to offer.

He married Shelly in 1982 and he went to college in Arlington and graduated with honors (member by invitation with the honor societies Tau Beta Pi, Chi Epsilon, and Golden Key) with a civil engineering degree.  During this time, he also ran a successful CADD detailing business -providing shop drawings for most, if not all, of his past employers.  He is still considered a stair expert in the DFW area, although he was also heavily involved detailing and designing structural steel, AWWA groundwater storage tanks, and ASME code pressure vessels.  All of his detailing was done at night and on weekends since 1991 so as not to interfere with his engineering job during the day, where he would develop the engineering designs.  He has worked in structural engineering or consulting firms in the DFW area for about 22 years and moved back home to Odessa in 2015.  He started Onsite Structural Engineering in the summer of 2016.

Doug and Shelly have no children, but during a 3-4 year stint as foster parents for code-red dogs (about to be put down) and working to find them ""forever homes"", they have acquired 4 dogs , so far.

Doug is a christian. He practices christian principles in his business and daily life.  He and his wife are members of, and attend Calvary Baptist Church in Odessa, where he sings in the choir, for special music, and serves as a church trustee."

"Do you wishcycle? When you throw items into the recycling “just in case” they’re recyclable? One soiled item could contaminate a whole truckload. So, know your P L A S T I C S to reduce “wishcycling”, dispose correctly, and reduce/stop using the bad ones.

Ever wonder what those plastic numbers mean?

There are 7 types of plastic, and only 2 are more commonly recycled. Any plastic #3-7 most likely ends up in landfill. Avoid those if possible. 🌍
Recycling works when the same types are in bulk.

1️⃣ Even though #1 is recyclable, only about 23% of these are recycled
2️⃣ Rinse these out before putting into recycling
3️⃣ Electronics recycling is available at many workspaces and stores like @homedepot @bestbuy. Collect your old wires, batteries, electronics and drop them off
4️⃣ Plastic bags suck. They get stuck in recycling processors and don’t get recycled unless they’re in bulk. Drop them off at the grocery store
5️⃣ Prescription bottles are #5, and they can only be safely recycled in bulk. Leave the meds inside and  bring them to a pharmacy that recycles to safely dispose 
6️⃣ Takeout containers and cutlery are crap. Avoid as much as possible cuz it goes straight to landfill after your one use 
7️⃣ Trash

What’s not recyclable and goes into landfill:
☕️ Disposable coffee cups
🥘 Takeout containers and cutlery
📍Plastic bags
📍Plastic toys

Recycling is not enough. REFUSE REFUSE REFUSE. Wash bottles and discard things in bulk

"During Earth Week 2020 (in April), we published a note discussing California's achievements in reducing urban air pollution (otherwise known as smog) since the first Earth Day in 1970, and also specifically noted that perhaps the longest consecutive stretch of ""good air quality"" days were observed for the Los Angeles-Long Beach-Anaheim tri-area region since at least 1995, and likely decades longer, from mid-March through early April of this year. To first order, this had been driven by favorable meteorology (many stormy days during that period, strong vertical mixing, colder-than-normal temperatures, etc.), but was also prolonged (the number of ongoing good air quality days) by fewer cars on the road during that time, which had coincided with the beginning of California's ""Safer at Home"" policy (which began on March 19th) and also the reduced mobility in the days leading up to the statewide restrictions. 

Today, we more broadly reflect on the reduction of emissions across the larger southwestern U.S. region by highlighting data analysis from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI), which is on board NASA's Aura satellite, showing a ""31% decrease in Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) levels in the Los Angeles basin"" between March 25th and April 25th, 2020 compared to the average during the previous five years (2015-2019) during the same period.  Decreases in NO2 were observed elsewhere, too, with a 25% reduction for San Diego and Tijuana, Mexico, a drop of 16% of NO2 in the Phoenix, AZ metro area, and a 22% decline in the San Francisco Bay Area.

We note that though there are natural sources of NO2, including volcanos, lightning, or bacterial respiration, anthropogenic (human) sources are from internal combustion, particularly motor vehicle traffic. Nitrogen Dioxide, while itself an air pollutant, is also a precursor to low-level ozone (O3) formation, detrimental in that part of the atmosphere (in the lower troposphere, as opposed to up in the stratosphere) to human health.  

To make the visualization easy, the map on the left, below, courtesy of NASA, shows the average Nitrogen Dioxide concentrations between March 25th and April 25th between 2015 and 2019, and the map on the right shows concentrations during the same period in 2020.

"East Phillips is a green zone and the City of Minneapolis Government is supposed to protect it from additional pollution.  

So why is the Minneapolis City Council allowing hundreds of pollution spewing diesel trucks to be placed in East Phillips, next to the Midtown Greenway?  

AND they are tearing down the historic building and replacing it with a surface parking lot for their trucks, right next to the Greenway.

Move the water yard!  Or at least mitigate this terrible plan by working with the East Phillips neighborhood to share the site and let them build an Urban Farm, Bike Shop, and Cafe along the Midtown Greenway!

"ELECTRIC GRID DEBATE IN MEXICO
The Ministry of Energy changed a few days ago the reliability energy policy introducing a series of charges to Renewable Energy Generators provided they want full integration to the Electric Grid. We must remind that Energy Reform privatized Generation of electricity both ways, on and off the grid. But in the first case it is subjected to approval of the carrier which is still the Comisión Federal de Electricidad (CFE) which was created as a public utility company and after the 2014 reform, it kept full ownership of the National Transmission Grid and the several local General Distribution grids as an strategical service reserved form governmental control and theoretically with the possibility of Public Private Agreements with non existent or uninvited private carriers. On the other hand, the office of CFE responsible of Power Forecast and  Dispatch, Centro Nacional de Control de Energia,   (CENACE) was elevated to a status of Technical Agency (Organismo Descentralizado) with a funny assignment to simulate a market where currently had only  organized public auctions where CFE must acquire the Energy produced by several intermittent eolic and photovoltaic power plants, in a frantic, unplanned and expensive rush to reach Climate Change Conference COP21 of 2015. It's funny that in Mexico every expert talks about a Conference that is an ongoing body of agreements that  goes from CMP14 Tokio Protocol from 1997 to COP24 of Katowice, Poland 2018, with an emphasis in trending and sensible updates like gender equality. We have a government unwilling to rise cost of utility for consumers and generators that want to force government to invest in modernization of the grid and everything in a profound clash of factions trying to prevail their point of view without agreement even though none of the factions understand the true role of an open market and the balance that could arise of establish an independent operator like American ISO."

"🚨EMERGENCY🚨 Fires, hurricanes, floods and droughts. Climate change is wreaking havoc on the world. Together, we can save vulnerable families from starvation."
"Emily, was a just simple girl living a simple life when one day she received a call from the police that changed her entire life. Everything that happened since then was nothing short of a roller-coaster ride.

She soon found out that her long-time boyfriend, Jack, was cheating on her with her best friend. As if things weren’t bad enough, she accidentally ended up in Jack’s uncle’s car. Soon, Emily found herself in a tug-o-war between her ex, Jack and his uncle, Jacob.

-------------------------------

""Hello. Is this Ms. Bai?"" the officer asked. ""Yes, "" replied Emily. ""Your friends, Mr. Jack Gu and Ms. Rose Xu have been arrested under suspicion of solicitation of prostitution. They both insisted that they were meeting each other at the hotel for a date. Could you please come down to the station and testify that they are indeed a couple, so that I can let them go…""

The shocking news froze Emily's body to the point where she couldn't move a single muscle. Her mind struggled to form thoughts and sentences; she couldn't concentrate on anything else the officer had to say. She didn't realize that she had hung up on the police officer and somehow managed to take a taxi to the police station. 

When she arrived at the police station…

With a single glance, she recognized the man and the woman sitting together in the hall. The man was her boyfriend, Jack Gu, and sitting next to him was her friend, Rose Xu. They were leaning against each other like a couple on their honeymoon. 

With her fists clenched; the anger boiling in her eyes like the infernal flames, Emily walked towards them. One step at a time; her feet felt like lead. 

Rose's eyes were the first to catch Emily's. ""I am so sorry, Emmy..."" said Rose with her deceitful eyes, pretending to be apologetic. 

Jack turned around and saw his girlfriend walking towards them. Without thinking, he spontaneously pushed Rose away and stood up in a rush, before Emily could even say anything. ""Hey Emmy, "" Jack greeted with a sheepish grin. 

He was panic-stricken, nervously shifting his eyes away from Emily's. His body went numb as he lost the courage to face Emily. 

""Tell her everything, Jack, "" Rose suggested. 

""Nonsense. Stop it! Don't even joke about that."" Jack glared at Rose, warning her to stop from spilling anything else.  He turned to Emily again. ""Emmy, I promise I'll explain everything to you later, but right now, I need you to tell the police that we're innocent, "" he requested as if it were a matter of course. 

He reached out his hand, but Emily wouldn't take it. She managed to squeeze out a sentence in response, ""You'd better have a good explanation for this."" She stared at Jack in disgust. 

After going through the necessary paperwork and formalities, Jack and Rose were released and the three of them left the police station together. 

""Jack, how could you do this to me? You jerk!"" Emily yelled angrily after stepping out of the police station. 

""Listen to me. Emmy!"" Jack frowned and pleaded, trying to hold Emily's hand as she pulled herself away. 

""I don't want to hear a single word from you! Not after you've been caught red handed, having an affair with another woman, "" Emily howled at Jack. ""How did it feel when the police officer accused you of screwing a prostitute? If I had known what was really going on, I would have never come to the station to bail you out."" Emily wiped the tears off her reddened eyes, full of anger and disappointment. 

To think they had the nerves to have the police call and ask Emily to bail them out, Emily felt sick to her stomach. Well, they got what they wanted if they were trying to disgust her! 

Embarrassed by Emily's words, Jack snapped back at her, ""Yeah, I slept with Rose. So what?""

After hearing those words, Emily felt light-headed and her heart sunk to her feet. She struggled to keep her balance. Jack approached her to help, but Emily jerked and pushed him away as if she had touched something dirty. 

""Just go! Stay away from me!""

Jack felt like his heart was being pierced by a thousand needles. ""Emmy, "" he murmured and finally changed to a softer tone, ""Forget about the other girls. You're the only one I love; my one and only.""

Jack's words incited Rose's jealousy, but she pretended to be understanding and tried to persuade Emily in a soft voice. ""He's right, Emmy. You and Jack are made for each other. I could never steal him away from you…""

""Shut up!"" Emily sternly interrupted Rose, gnashing her teeth in anger, ""You have no right to say anything! We're done! We are no longer friends.""

""Emmy, please don't do this to me..."" Rose pleaded in a sad tone while her eyes were like a bad disguise, clumsily revealing her complacence and arrogance. 

Hmph, if it were not for Jack, she would have never made friends with a woman like Emily! Now that she had accomplished what she set out to do, making the extra effort seemed quite unnecessary. 

""Emmy, don't make a mountain out of a mole-hill, "" said Jack impatiently. ""I've promised that I will only love and marry you. What else do you want? 

""Make a mountain out of a mole-hill? By love, do you mean sleeping with other women and lying to me the whole time? Sorry, but I will not stand for that kind of love any longer!""

""Is it not enough that I love only you and you alone?""

""It's not enough. Love needs loyalty. But, you obviously, are not loyal to me!""

Jack burst out laughing because he found her words to be amusing and as naive as a newborn babe. He said to her, ""Emmy, I'm the firstborn and only son of my father; the Master of Gu clan. I will never have only one woman by my side no matter if I'm single or married. Do you understand? 

You should learn to accept that before we get married. The sooner, the better.""

""But the place of my wife will only be left for you. Other women will come and go, but your position will never change.""

In his head, Jack imagined that he sounded romantic and charming, while waiting for Emily to be moved by his words, and jump into his arms. 

""Thwack!"" Emily served him a mercilessly, tight slap across his face. 

Jack's face stung as he tilted his head. Clearly visible under the street lamp, her hand had left a red welt on his face. His eyes were filled with shock as he staggered backwards. 

How dare she slap him? 

Rose was stunned, motionless. She recollected her senses and feigned concern by checking his face, only to be rejected by Jack at once. 

""Emily, what's wrong with you?"" Jack howled angrily, looking at her with disbelief and fury. 

Born with a silver spoon in his mouth, he had never been hit by anyone since he came to this world. 

Thinking of his cruel words and his lack of remorse, Emily also trembled with rage. ""I never realized how deplorable and arrogant you are, until now.""

Share a husband with other women? How could he even dream of this? 

Although she was looking right at him, her eyes felt an odd sensation of strangeness, as if she had never really known him at all. 

""Jack, I'm breaking up with you. We're done.""

Emily was ready to leave, exhausted and lacking the strength to put up with the drama any longer. She harbored resentment in her heart but soon realized that there was no point in allowing him to extend her misery, because he would turn her world upside down. 

""I disagree!"" Jack roared. Suddenly, he sensed a fear of loss as if he was going to lose something valuable and irreplaceable to him... 

Just as he was about to run after Emily, Rose came from behind and hugged him tightly. 

""Jack, don't leave me alone…"" Rose skillfully placed her arms around Jack's waist and touched him while persuading him gently, ""Emmy is just too angry to think clearly right now. She didn't mean that. You should give her some time to calm down. You are such a great guy. How could she give up on you?""

Once Jack understood what Rose had said, he eventually calmed down. 

The Gu clan, a prestigious clan with centuries of prosperous history, was the main source of the city's political power. They could almost do whatever they wanted in this city. Jack Gu was his father's only son and heir, which showed his incomparable status in society. Apart from that, he was also blessed with striking good looks. How could Emily find another man like him? 

It would do her good to take a few days off to cool down and reconsider their relationship. Meanwhile, Jack thought she must came to be aware of the fact that even though he loved her; his patience was not without limitations. If he had been slapped by anyone else other than Emily, he would have broken their hands! 

Chapter 2 You Reckless Woman

""Jack, I'm feeling a little cold.""  Rose smiled and continued her seduction, trying to allure the beast within him. Her voice had the softness and sweetness no man could resist. 

Jack wrapped his arms around Rose's waist at once and said, ""Uh, let's go inside the car and get you warm.""

Getting laid with a woman was as easy and meaningless as having a meal for Jack. 

However, Emily was his favorite one. Although he had been wanting to have her so badly for quite some time. He wanted her to give herself to him before he made his move. 

... 

Although they were only together for three years, Emily had given him her sincerest devotion. It shook her up  to experience such a shocking betrayal from her boyfriend and best friend at the same time. In a daze, she went to a bar to drown her sorrows in alcohol. 

It was around 2 A.M in the morning. Emily walked out of the bar alone, totally drunk out of her mind. She took off her high heels and staggered across the middle of the road. 

A glaringly bright headlight caught her attention. Emily froze in her tracks, confused and puzzled. She stood there, helplessly watching a black Maybach driving straight towards her. 

""Ouch——"" Emily fell down, as the car screeched to a halt right in front of her. 

Meanwhile, inside the car, the impact from the sudden brake, caused the person in the back, who was resting with his eyes closed, to jump off from his seat. He opened his eyes with a frown of dissatisfaction on his face. He cast a sharp glance at Sam, the person driving the car, who also happened to be his personal assistant. 

""What happened?""

""Mr. Gu, "" Sam replied, as beads of sweat broke out from his forehead. He continued, ""Someone appeared in front of the car out of nowhere, but I hit the brakes as hard as I could. I didn't hit the person for sure. It must be a racketeer.""

""Go and have a look.""

""Yes, Mr. Gu.""

Sam immediately got out of the car to check on the person. The first thing that came into sight under the streetlight, was a beautiful woman lying in front of their car, unconscious. As Sam went to have a closer look, he soon noticed the strong smell of alcohol on her. She didn't seem to be a racketeer. 

""Hey, miss! Wake up!""

It came as a shock to him, when he recognized the person in front of him. 

'Isn't she Emily Bai, Mr. Jack's girlfriend?  How did she end up here like this?' Sam wondered. 

Fortunately, it was him who was driving the car. If it were someone else, she might have gotten run over! 

Sam did not dare to make a decision on his own without proper authorization, so he hurried back for his boss' instruction. ""Mr. Gu, the person lying unconscious in front of our car is Mr. Jack's girlfriend, Miss Emily Bai. She seems to be highly inebriated...""

Jacob Gu's eyes flipped wide open. He remembered her, the girl Jack had brought back home before. She was a lovely girl with a sweet smile. With another second's hesitation he demanded, ""Get her inside the car.""

As soon as he received the order, Sam lifted Emily up to the car at once

Emily felt discomfort lying awkwardly in the car. She mumbled, opened her eyes, and then stared blankly at the man who was sitting beside her and pressing his forehead between his eye-brows. Emily asked, ""Who are you...""

The man turned to look at her, with a blank expression on his face. 

Emily widened her eyes and finally recognized who the man next to her was. She stammered, ""Ja- Jacob? It...It is you!""

Jacob ignored her and told Sam to drive straight to Jack's house. 

The mere utterance of Jack's name infuriated Emily immediately. ""I don't want to go to his place. I've broken up with him!""

""Broke up?"" Jacob repeated her words in a casual manner and raised his eyebrows. 

""Yes, we broke up..."" Emily sniffled. The tears gushed out of her eyes as soon as she recalled what had happened earlier that day. Emily broke down and continued, ""He slept with another woman... 

And was held up in the police station under suspicion of soliciting prostitution!""

She deliberately described the matter in a serious tone without realizing that she was coming off as a primary school student, complaining to her teacher. 

Jacob squinted his long and narrow eyes at her words. 'Prostitution? it seems like Jack hasn't been disciplined in a while, ' Jacob thought. 

As a matter of fact, Jacob never asked for too much of his nephew, because he was not really related to Jack by blood. He didn't mind the occasional philandering, just as long as Jack didn't drag the Gu's family name to the mud with allegations such as ""prostitution"". 

""Jacob, you need to teach him a serious lesson!""

Jacob continued to deliberately ignore Emily as she angrily stressed her words again. Emilysimply assumed that he didn't hear what she was saying, so she moved closer to Jacob. She clenched Jacob's collar, pulled him closer towards her and said, ""Did you hear what I said?""

""You should teach him a lesson!"" Emily's voice was soft and enticing. 

""I should teach you a lesson first."" Jacob pushed Emily's head away and whispered hoarsely, ""Get up!""

""Jack is such a bastard! And you, you must be a bad one too! All men in the world are assholes..."" Emily said. 

Under different circumstances, she wouldn't have dared to look at Jacob, for she was scared of his ruthlessness. However, at that moment, under the influence of the alcohol, Emily was being absolutely reckless, and she was spewing whatever nonsense that came into her head, without considering its consequences. 

""He said I'd have to get used to his illicit relationships with other women apart from myself. Screw him, that shameless man!"" Emily angrily cursed, then she switched her anger to Jacob, ""You are probably the same as him... 

And you are a CEO yourself, so you must be surrounded by flocks of women, enough to fill a football stadium, fawning over you all the time..."" 

""Damn it, you reckless woman! You seduced me first; you've brought this upon yourself.""

Chapter 3 She Deserves This

Just as he intended to move forward to the next step, he was abruptly interrupted by Sam's voice from the driver's seat. 

""Mr. Gu, we've reached Theodore Villa."" This was Jack's villa; where he lived alone since he became an adult. 

""Turn the car around; go back to Tyrone Mansion, "" his tone was full of displeasure. 

""Yes, Mr. Gu!"" Although Sam did not dare to have a peek, he was smart enough to understand what was happening in the back; thanks to the noise. 

""Miss Bai is Mr. Jack's girlfriend. How could Mr. Jacob..."" Sam wondered. 

Sam kept hearing them making out in the back. He suddenly wished he were deaf, so he wouldn't be able to hear what they were doing. 

The car sped off and soon arrived at Tyrone Mansion. 

Jacob helped Emily out of the car and carried her all the way into the villa. He held her gently; helped her up the stairs and brought her to the master bedroom. 

Emily was so exhausted from having an excessively eventful day, she wanted to fall asleep at the very sight of a bed. 

The next afternoon, Emily woke up from a long and deep sleep. Her entire body ached as if she had been run over by a train last night. 

She looked around to see if there was anyone else in the room, only to find that she was the only person in the room. Emily lay on the big bed and stared blankly at the exquisitely designed engravings on the ceiling. Fragments of last night's memory slowly seeped into her mind; the fragments came together like puzzle pieces and formed an indescribable image... 

Boom! 

Figuratively speaking, Emily's head exploded in an instant. 'I, I seemed to have slept with a man last night! And, the man... the man is Jack's uncle, Jacob! 

Jesus!' Emily thought, in utter shock. 

Jacob turned 27 years old this year. Although Jack and this so-called uncle are not related by blood, she always regarded and respected him as Jack's real uncle. How could this happen between them?! 

Emily now bitterly regretted going to the bar last night. If she had not gotten herself completely drunk, she would have never met Jacob on the road, and they would never have... 

She had brought this upon herself! 

Suddenly, she heard a knock on the door; it almost gave her a heart attack. 

'What should I do? How will I face this guy?'

Before Emily could recollect her thoughts, the voice of a maidservant broke in from outside the room, ""Are you awake, Miss?""

Hearing the maidservant's voice came as a great relief to Emily. At least, it was not Jacob. ""Yes, please, come in.""

When she sat up straight, the bed sheet covering her body slipped, revealing the traces of last night's debauchery on her naked, snow-white skin. 

Alas, it was too late to stop the maidservant from coming in. She entered through the door and saw the traces all over Emily's body. With a look of vague emotions that Emily couldn't read, the maidservant said, ""Here are some fresh clothes for you, Miss.""

Emily frowned in embarrassment. As she intended to refuse the maidservant, she caught a glimpse of her clothes on the floor. Emily blushed and said in a low voice, ""Thank you!""

She struggled for a moment and then finally asked, ""Where is Uncle...Mr. Gu?""

""Mr. Gu went to his company."" The maidservant was envious of Emily because she was the first woman Jacob had ever brought over to his own house. In her jealousy, she did not give Emily the message that Jacob had left for her. 

Emily noticed the maidservant's obnoxious attitude, so she stopped talking to her. After the maid left the room, Emily got dressed in a hurry, then she called a taxi and left Tyrone Mansion before Jacob came back. 

Jacob arrived at the Tyrone Mansion, just after Emily's taxi left. 

He was disappointed to find his room empty. 

After a few seconds, Jacob yanked the sheet which still had Emily's residual temperature on it. There were drops of blood on the white sheet, which indicated that Jacob was her first man. 

His sight finally moved from the sheet and there were something different appeared in his eyes. 

As a grown man, he could have pushed her away last night. Instead of doing so, he acted on his instincts. 

He had to admit that he had been seduced by Emily. 

... 

Emily did not go to work after she left Tyrone Mansion, instead she called the company and asked for a leave. She went back to her apartment, and slept until the next morning. She woke up and finally went back to work. 

When she saw Jack's Aston Martin parked at the company gate, she reckoned it was going to be a rough day for her. 

Rose gracefully stepped out of the car, with her fabulous stilettos and a sweet smile on her face. 

When Jack got out of his car, he deliberately ignored Emily and pulled Rose close to give her a hot, passionate kiss in front of everybody. Rose panted and was almost out of breathe from Jack's kiss. 

""Jack, everyone's watching us. Stop it..."" Rose said with coquetry and gently brushed her hands over his manly chest. 

Jack wrapped his arms around her tiny waist and said with a flirtatious smile, ""You are such a tease.""

Emily glanced with a scornful look at the people watching them from not too far away, and walked straight through the company gate without looking back. 

Jack did it all purposely in front of Emily to send her a warning. Unfortunately, Emily did not give him the attention he wanted and casually walked by. All of a sudden Jack got disheartened and even a little sad. 

""All right, I'm leaving now.""

Jack pushed Rose away casually; he got in his car and then drove away. 

From that night until now, he did not feel an ounce of remorse for what he had done. Considering his social status, playing around with women was a trivial matter to him. What was the big deal anyway? 

Emily was the one he was to marry at last and nothing would change fact. This was the best love he had to offer her. 

What he did just then before Emily was for her own good. If she could not tolerate such instances, how would she be his gentle and kind wife? 

Hogan Company. 

Emily decided to suppress her traumatic experience and focus on her work, but one way or the other, there was always someone or something that would go against her wishes. 

""Hey, Rose! Did Mr. Jack dump Emily? Look at how depressed she looks!""

""Yeah, you and Mr. Jack look good together!""

""I knew it! How did Mr. Jack ever stand such a phony woman like her? Rose and Jack are more suited for each other...""

Listening to the flatteries and compliments from her female colleagues boosted Rose's ego and greatly satisfied her vanity. She pretended to be displeased and insisted, ""Stop! Emily and I are good friends. I don't want to hurt her...""

""Are you done?"" Emily looked at her in disdain, ""If you are done, please stop disgusting me.""

""How could you say that, Emily?"" Rose bit her underlip; she was unwilling to accept such words from Emily. 

The people around Rose are always fickle and devious. They resorted to provocation and said, ""Oh, my! Check this woman's attitude! Rose, you don't have to talk to her in such polite manner! She deserves this!""

Chapter 4 Hickeys On The Neck

""Please say no more."" Rose shook her head, but smirked slightly, ""You've misunderstood me, Emily. I was just trying to comfort you.""

She feigned sincerity, but her heart was full of pride. 

They'd been friends since they were in college, but in comparison, Emily seemed to be better than her at everything; even Emily's boyfriend had better features and family background than Rose's. Why? 

Rose, however, didn't believe that she was second to Emily. She tried every means to surpass Emily, including stealing her boyfriend. Finally, she had managed to break them up and it was proof that Emily had lost to her in love. Her superiority complex was soaring off the charts. 

Emily clenched her fists, glared at her pretentious face coldly and said, ""So, it must feel good to be Jack's mistress?""

""No, that was not my intention. It was Jack who..."" With a hint of pretentious helplessness and kindness in her tone, Rose walked close to Emily all of a sudden, and gently asked, ""How can you blame me, if you can't even keep your boyfriend in check? He'd never ever touch you, right? Instead, he'd rather to sleep me or any other woman. Also, you couldn't imagine how much he enjoyed being in bed with me...""

Rose wore a dress that specifically highlighted her shoulders, just to show off the marks Jack had left on her neck, collarbones and shoulders. 

Emily was nauseated by the sight of Rose's shoulders; with a hint of disgust in her eyes, she said to her, ""Sorry, I was wrong. You're not a mistress.""

As to the affair, she wasn't bothered by Rose anymore because it was a well-known fact that Jack was a womanizer. The fact that Rose didn't mind sleeping with a man like Jack, came as a surprise to Emily. In her personal opinion, a man who had multiple love affairs with other women was just like a toothbrush that had been used many times by various people. And similarly, Jack too was such a man, or, more exactly, such a toothbrush. She really couldn't understand how Rose could gladly use that toothbrush to brush her teeth, without any complains? 

The words immediately embarrassed Rose, but she had to keep herself from going berserk because she had to play nice ans sweet in front of the people around her. She simply said, ""You talk a lot of nonsense...""

""Nonsense? You know it's truth, don't you? After all I'm better than those who don't know how to live and function without a man. Oh, and thank you for recycling the junk I don't want.""

Soon, the onlookers felt the awkwardness in the room intensified; they made excuses to leave, and dispersed shortly after. 

""Ah! Mr. Hua has asked me to take these files to his office urgently, so sorry I can't chat right now."" Emily was just leaving after organizing the files on the desk. Seeing Rose distraught, made her feel a little better. 

Rose was so mad at Emily that she had planned to embarrass her before she left. She reached out to grab Emily's hand, but unfortunately, Emily moved too soon; instead of catching Emily, she accidentally caught the files Emily was holding. 

Paper after paper, they fell everywhere at once. 

""Are you nuts?"" Instead of arguing with her, Emily hurried and got down to pick up the files from the floor. 

Rose wasn't finished with Emily; when she looked down at Emily, something else had caught her immediate attention. 

What were they? Hickeys! There were hickeys on Emily's neck! 

Rose couldn't believe her eyes, as she attentively glared at the marks on Emily's neck. Despite Emily's high-necked top, she was still able to see the red marks on her back. 

Rose was quick to determine that it couldn't have been Jack because he was with her yesterday and the day before that. Then who? 

Rose secretly took a photo of Emily's neck before she could notice and sent it to Jack. She was giddily waiting to see Jack's reaction to the photo. 

She knew once Jack found out that Emily had slept with someone else, he would certainly go stark raving mad instead of swallowing the humiliation, therefore further ensuring the permanence of Jack and Emily's separation. 

Emily didn't notice what Rose was scheming. She came back to her desk after picking up the files and sending them to Mr. Hua. 

She was lost in her thoughts, imagining how things would be if it all turned out to be false; how nice it would be if Jack hadn't betrayed her; if Rose hadn't seduced her boyfriend and if she hadn't slept with... Jacob.... 

But, she knew that the reality was far from her imaginations. She backed the wrong horses when she chose to be together with Jack and made friends with Rose. The affair with Jacob was also a byproduct of her own wrongdoings. 

After getting off work, Emily was just about to leave the office, when she saw Jack's car parked at the gate of the company. She tried to pretend not seeing Jack and walked past his car, but Jack got out of his car and walked straight towards her. 

Emily wasn't aware that Jack was angry at her because of the photo Rose had sent to him. 

Initially, he had intended to give Emily the cold shoulder for a few days until she'd come to her senses and back into his arms. But much to his surprise and disappointment, Emily had an affair with another man on the same night she had found out about his affair with Rose. 

""Stop!  Emily Bai!"" Jack grabbed Emily by the arms, with an angry look on his face. 

""Let go of me!"" Emily struggled but refused to look at his face. The mere thought of what had happened in the police station, dissolved whatever feelings she had for him. ""Are you insane?"" She asked impatiently. 

Emily always waited for her colleagues to leave the company first, before she would leave, and so there was nobody around to help her. 

""You are a fast learner, Emily! since you are dared to cuckold me! Tell me where you were yesterday and the night before !""

His words caught Emily by surprise, as she tried to hide the truth from him, ""Why should I answer to you, Jack?  We were already broke up the night before yesterday!""

""I told you I didn't agree to breaking up with you!""

""For us, it was over the moment when you slept with Rose!""

""That's impossible!"" Jack growled when reaching out to pull Emily's collar. Sure enough, he saw the ambiguous marks on her skin. In his mind, they were enough to prove her love affair with another man. Jack screamed angrily at her, ""Emily Bai! Who is he?""

""It's none of your business!"" Emily bit her lip, with an inkling of bitterness in her heart, as she dared not to speak out the name of that man. Although she had no intentions of getting back with Jack, she still struggled to gather the courage to tell him the truth. 

Realizing that Emily was hiding something from him, Jack struggled to breath; it felt like his heart was being pounded with a heavy hammer.  He couldn't believe that the woman he had loved for years would betray him like that. 

He stared at Emily furiously, gripping her hand tightly and almost crushing her bones! 

""Tell me!""

""Let go of me!"" At the thought of the unbridled intimacy shown by Jack and Rose this morning, Emily felt displeased, and so not to be outdone, she just answered, ""You don't deserve to know his name!""

""I am going to make you and that man regret this, Emily!""

""My only regret is knowing a scum like you! Why? Why is it okay for you to sleep around, but I can't? I'm learning from you!""

""Are men and women the same?""

""Yes, they are the same to me! I really regret not cheating on you before breaking up with you!"" She was grateful that Jack was not the first person she had made love to, otherwise she wouldn't stop feeling sorry for herself. 

""Emily!"" Jack's blood boiled with immense fury. The anger in his eyes burned so furiously, it seemed that the flames would almost spread out of his eyes to burn the woman in front of him. 

Frightened by his rage, Emily tried to run away, but Jack caught her and dragged her into his car. 

""Let me go!"" Suddenly, Emily started to have a bad feeling.

""Have you ever been dated with another man? ""

Jack completely lost his senses! 

Chapter 5 Overwhelming Darkness

Emily never imagined that Jack could be so angry, violent and irrational at the same time; she began to grow fearful of him. She struggled out of desperation, ""Get off! Don't touch me!""

There was not a snowball's chance in hell she was going to sleep with Jack now! 

""Why can't I touch you? Emily, you're tainted and filthy damaged goods right now. You should be grateful that I'm still willing to!""

Jack screamed at her fiercely; with eyes piercing with anger, he glared at her as if he would skin her alive. 

""Beep—"" out of the blue, Jack was interrupted by the shrill sound of a car horn blaring from behind his car. Jack and Emily were both caught by surprise. 

Taking advantage of the moment, Emily caught Jack off guard and raised her foot to kick him, as hard as she could. 

""Ah..."" whimpered Jack, as his eyes squeezed shut in excruciating pain; the wind knocked out of his sails. 

Emily shoved him aside; swiftly gathered her clothes and got out of the car in a panic-stricken manner. She ran as fast as she could, paying no attention to her surroundings, as if she were being chased by the Devil. 

Jack watched her slowly disappear into the distance, unable to go after her as he helplessly writhed in pain. With the last of his strength and spirit he managed to muster up one last desperate cry in anger, ""Emily...""

Jack couldn't accept letting go of Emily so easily. He couldn't stomach the fact that he was betrayed by his beloved girlfriend, who slept with another man before he could have a taste. Dark clouds of vengeance filled his heart as he promised himself to make Emily and her new lover pay for what they had done to him! 

When Jack finally managed to catch his breath, he remembered the blaring car horn that had abruptly interrupted his evening with Emily. He got out of the car to look for the source of all his immediate frustrations. 

He immediately froze in his path when he realized that Maybach, parked not too far away, looked familiar. Not only did he know who the owner of the car was, he was also quite daunted by the person. 

As if to prove Jack's point, the man got out of the Maybach and walked towards Jack with a stony expression on his face and a stare that could freeze the ocean. 

Jack ran his hands through his hair, fixed his clothes and stood up straight as he looked at the man walking towards him. 

Yes, it was Jacob Gu, the adopted son of his grandfather and therefore, his nominal uncle. Jacob was just three years older than he was. Although Jacob was still young, he had served already as the CEO of their family business. Jack had heard of his uncle's aggressive reputation; he had a touch of reverence and admiration in his heart for his uncle. 

He wasn't sure whether Jacob had caught him in the act just now, and yet somehow he still felt apprehensive as if he were guilty of doing something bad, ""Uncle Jacob, what are you...""

""Bang!""

Jack's words were unexpectedly interrupted as Jacob came in straight and punched him hard across the face, in response. 

Jack lost the words to express himself; he was completely dumbfounded by Jacob's punch. ""Uncle Jacob?""

However, to add to Jack's disappointment, Jacob had no intention of explaining himself at all. Jacob didn't utter a single word; he followed his surprise punch, with a quick and fierce kick to Jack's abdomen. 

Jack instantly fell to the ground, squirming. Despite his respect for Jacob, he couldn't stand being beaten up by him, for no reason or explanation at all. He pleaded, ""Uncle Jacob, what's the matter?""

Jack's words angered Jacob even more; he continued to brutally assault Jack as if he wanted to beat him to death. 

Jack knew he was no match for his uncle; considering Jacob's position in the family, he didn't dare to fight back in retaliation. He bit the pain and endured one punch after the other, until finally he had lost the heart to endure even that. 

Unfortunately, Jacob left soon after; leaving him with no explanations but only Sam to take him to the hospital. 

Even after being treated in the hospital, Jack was still hurting all over. On top of that, he still didn't know why Jacob had unleashed his fury on him like that. 

As a matter of fact, Jacob had always been very nice to him, providing him with proper education and opportunities and granting him privileges. Jacob even forgave his transgressions so long as the reputation of the family was not at stake. 

Jack wondered whether it was because Jacob had already found out about his visit to the police station. 

The more Jack thought about it, the more certain he became. 'Yes, that must be the reason, ' he thought. He figured it wasn't because Jacob had caught him red handed, forcing himself on Emily just now, as it would apparently be a waste of his time to attack Jack for a stranger. Jesus! 

With regards to Jacob, he would just have to be more careful in the future. But as to Emily... How dare she betray him! He swore to find Emily's mysterious lover, as he wanted to bash his head in for touching his girlfriend! 

Emily spent the next few days in peace, away from Jack's harassment as he was confined to this hospital bed. However, the news of their break-up had spread all over her company like wildfire. To add to that, thanks to Rose's lies, everyone in the company regarded Emily as a shameless woman for cheating on her boyfriend which finally led to their break-up. 

Emily sneered at the thought of that. 'Is she talking about herself?' mused Emily, wondering how Rose could be so shameless as to lie to everyone and frame Emily in such a vicious way. 

Although, in disdain, she refused to defend herself; she was affected by the rumors anyway. Not only was she demoted by Mr. Hua on all accounts, she was also made to be one of Rose's assistants. 

Rose couldn't be more complacent, as she believed she had won over Emily again. Rose had been jealous of Emily for being a far more talented jewellery designer than her. 'So what?' Rose snickered at the thought of Emily's demotion. From now on Emily would have to follow her orders obediently! 

That day at work, Rose deliberately arranged a lot of work for Emily, so that she would have to work overtime in the company. 

By the time Emily had finished her work, it was almost 9 PM. When she got out to leave the company, she found that everyone had already gone home, and she was the only one left in the office. 

She packed up her items and was about to leave, when she noticed that the door of the office seemed to have been locked from the outside. 

Emily had no doubt in her mind that Rose was behind this. 

She was confused and lost in her thoughts when she suddenly heard a 'pop'. Soon after, the lights in the office had gone off and all of a sudden the entire office was shrouded in darkness. 

Emily's complexion turned pale. She was beginning to feel claustrophobic and the dark atmosphere reminded her of the traumatic experiences of being kidnapped, she suffered, when she was just a child. 

In fact, Rose was well aware of this fact as they had been friends for so long. 

It was too dark in the office to see anything. Emily calmed herself down, fumbled in her bag for the phone and then clicked on the address book. 

She tentatively called a few colleagues for help; they all answered her in a few perfunctory words before hanging up quickly, as if they had come up the excuses together. Rose's involvement in the matter was obvious. 

Emily didn't have many friends; to make matters worse, whatever friends she had, were living in other places. 

Emily hesitated for a moment before deciding to call Jack. At the very least, she had hoped that he would help her for old time's sake. 

Unfortunately, all her hopes were in vain as Rose answered Jack's phone. 

She realized it was stupid of her to call Jack for help. 

After a brief moment of self-loathing, Emily sat down against the wall and held her phone tightly, not knowing who to ask for help. 

She was overwhelmed by the darkness and the eerie silence that had taken over the room. Emily felt more and more frightened with each passing minute. The traumatic memories of her kidnapping in her childhood gradually recurred in her mind, emerging from her anxiety of the darkness around her.  Despair and fear flooded her thoughts once again, overwhelming and almost suffocating her. 

""No, I can't stay here..."" Emily started to become upset, as tiny beads of sweat poured out of her forehead. She gripped her phone firmly, scrolling up and down on the screen, until the name ""Jacob"" appeared.

"*ENDANGERED SPECIES*

For 200 years, human activities have caused a steady decline in seaturtle populations. Slaughtered for their eggs, meat, skin and shells, seaturtles suffer from poaching and over-population!

All species of sea turtles are now considered to be threatened and endangered. They are protected under the United States Endangered Species Act of 1973 that briefly stated people in violation (harming turtles, nests or eggs) could be fined up to $100,000

Other human activities that contribute to the plummeting of population numbers include pollution of waters, chemicals, and discarded fish line, nets and hooks

Let's take action by switching to reusable products, as well as, helping local and international organizations aimed at sea turtle conservation and plastic pollution

Air pollution is responsible for 1 in 9 deaths and is the single largest environmental health crisis we face, according to the World Health Organization. The concentration of particulate matter (PM) in the air is often used as a measurement of air quality. PM refers to small particles suspended in the air and the size of the particles determines how far they can travel into the respiratory system. Particles with a diameter of 10µm or less (PM10) can penetrate deep inside the lungs, whereas fine particles with a diameter of 2.5µm or less (PM2.5) can go even further into the blood stream and spread to other organs. Long-term exposure to PM can result in significant damage to your health.✅

Yes! With filter efficiency of 98% for particles 0,3 μm in size, the Urban Air Mask provides highly effective protection from airborne contaminants and reduces exposure to bacteria, which are commonly 0.3μm - 60μm in size.⭐️

Plastic in fish and even honey. Scientists are alarming
Plastic bags have long been recognized as one of the main causes of environmental degradation and health problems. Bags damage crop fields and promote the hatching of mosquitoes carrying malaria and dengue.

The Mediterranean Sea is considered one of the largest clusters of floating microplastics in the world. The highest concentration was found in waters near peninsulas, up to 500,000 microparticles per square kilometer. The average is around 100,000 particles per square km. Polyethylene, polypropylene and polystyrene are the most common types of microplastic in these waters.

"Examining Two Crises (Coronavirus and Climate Change) Through a Psychological Lens

Join us for this timely virtual talk with Dr. Christie Manning of Macalester College! 

With the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and shelter-in-place order, we have worked with our presenter to make this Dinner on the Bluff event VIRTUAL! Of course, this means unfortunately we cannot serve the delicious dinner we had planned for this event – however, Dr. Manning has shared with us one of her favorite spring recipes for you to make and enjoy while you tune in to her presentation (see recipe in registration link)!

Saturday, April 18, 6pm via Zoom

Speaker:
Christie Manning, PhD, Director of Sustainability at Macalester College

Talk description:
Our lives have recently been upended by the coronavirus pandemic. It took world governments by surprise with its quick spread and its ability to overwhelm local and national medical systems. The global community has responded with sweeping measures to contain the virus, and we suddenly find ourselves in a dramatically changed world. The scale of action is head-spinning, and though it is disorganized, uneven, and full of adverse consequences, it shows what the world is capable of when we collectively acknowledge a shared danger.

Dr. Manning will speak on how we perceive and understand issues such as climate change and the pandemic, the mental health and well-being impacts of both the pandemic and the climate crisis, and the psychological lessons we can learn from the pandemic to motivate action on the climate crisis.

"Excited to announce The Outlaw Ocean Music Project, which is an innovative collaboration that melds music with journalism. I’ve enjoyed being a part of this project with Ian Urbina.

”Submarine” inspired by his book “The Outlaw Ocean” is out now everywhere! https://www.theoutlawoceanmusic.com/artists/olwik

This track was inspired by “The Final Frontier” chapter in The Outlaw Ocean. It was crazy to learn about the battles that occur on land over the ocean. These battles between big companies and scientists and conservationists are intense because there is so much at stake based on the ruling of a court or government. I wanted to match that intensity with my song. 

“The Final Frontier” chapter’s story about Greenpeace’s fight against seafloor trawlers also hit close to home for me—literally. Since I’m from Sweden, I felt encouraged learning that the Swedish courts rejected legal claims from fishermen that Greenpeace’s actions were illegal. I am proud that our country has a forward-thinking view when it comes to climate change and combating all its root causes.

It was through the use of a submarine that Ian and others got to visit these voids in person. The submarine became a literal and figurative tool for helping journalists shine a light on the reality of what is happening. I hope that my song can be a tool as well, traveling deep but still finding hope in uplifting, melodic moments. As a musician, a big part of my artistry is performing at nightclubs and festivals, and I’m all about bringing emotion to the crowd. With “Submarine,” I use intensity in my music to create a mighty atmosphere that I hope will bring a sense of unity and help people realize that we are in the struggle together and we are not alone. I also hope it makes people want to jump or dance.”"

"📢  EXTREMELY IMPORTANT TIME SENSITIVE ANNOUNCEMENT 📢

Centre County Announces Suspension of Curbside Recycling Collection in response to COVID-19

The Centre County Recycling & Refuse Authority (CCRRA) is announcing the suspension of our curbside recycling collection program to help limit the local impact of COVID-19 and protect our workers. This suspension begins Monday, March 30, and will remain in place until further notice. All trash/refuse collection services will remain unchanged at this time.

The reason behind this change in service is due to the curbside recycling hand sorting of items in each curbside recycling bin and the many unknowns about how long the COVID-19 virus remains viable on surfaces.  This service is being suspended to limit our workers’ potential exposure to the virus and to reduce chances of the spread of COVID-19. 
Residents are advised to store their recyclable materials until service resumes if possible, or utilize one of our 43 drop off sites throughout the county.  

CCRRA is working with local municipalities to expand drop-off services for recyclable materials during this curbside service suspension. Please visit the drop off recycling page on CCRRA’s website at: https://www.centrecountyrecycles.org/dropoffrecycling

The above drop off recycling webpage contains a list of current drop off locations as well as materials that are accepted at each.  Remember to exercise social distancing at all recycling drop off locations.

As we all deal with this public emergency, we are continuously balancing the most important health and wellbeing issues for our employees and the general public with the economic and business concerns in our community, and our commitment to providing public services to ensure the public health, safety and welfare.  

While we understand that the suspension of the curbside recycling program will alter efforts to help the county reduce waste going to the landfill, we must implement every action practical to limit community spread and protect our workers from COVID-19. We appreciate the community’s understanding of these measures during this critical time. 

For additional information on this, please call our office at 814-238-7005, or contact us by e-mail at aschirf@centrecountyrecycles.org."
"Fact: 18 billion pounds of plastic waste flows into the oceans every year from coastal regions. That’s the equivalent of five grocery bags of plastic trash polluting every foot of coastline around the world. (Source: National Geographic) 

You can avoid adding to the problem of ocean plastic waste by: 
1️⃣ Reducing your use of single-use plastics
2️⃣ Ditching products containing microbeads
3️⃣ Support organizations that address plastic pollution, like The Preserve Ocean Plastic Initiative (POPi), which creates helpful products from rescued plastic at-risk of polluting coastlines and waterways ocean and donates proceeds to nonprofits that work to support marine conservation.

"Fanta’s Designs is raising money towards preserving well water in a small community called Kuntoloh located in the Eastern area of Freetown, Sierra Leone. The name of the well is called “JAMA well” which means “Public well”. Families in the community wake up at 5:00 in the morning to fetch water from this well for daily use such as drinking, bathing and cleaning. The water that surrounds this well is polluted with debris, food and waste. Contaminated water can cause diseases such as Typhoid and Cholera. To keep this water well safe we would like to build a bridge to easily access the water and build a fence around the well to prevent the water from being contaminated. Our ultimate goal is to provide fresh and clean water to the community of Kuntoloh. Please follow the link in bio to make a donation. Thank you! 🙏🏾

WHY CHASE?

JPMorgan Chase is by far the biggest funder of the fossil fuel industry worldwide - the ONLY U.S. funder of the Jordan Cove Pipeline.

In the 3 years since the Paris Agreement, JPMorgan Chase provided the fossil fuel industry with $196 billion in financing.
They are the #1 banker of arctic oil & gas drilling, the #1 banker of ultra-deepwater oil & gas drilling, the #2 banker of fracking (right behind Wells Fargo), the #1 banker of Liquid Natural Gas and the #1 U.S. banker of coal mining."
"February 27, 2020- Last night President Trump made Vice President Pence the liaison between all the agencies working on the CoronaVirus. The Left went nuts. Can you say triggered?  They must have put out a “talking point” this morning. It seems all the democrat pundits are using AOC’s false statement that Pence does not believe in science. Their examples?  Climate change denial and that his response to HIV was to pray for the infected. Both of these are false accusations. 
I won’t go into the Climate Change argument, it’s the old climate denier garbage. You can read the CNN transcript here: https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.cnn.com/cnn/2019/06/24/politics/mike-pence-climate-crisis/index.html

What really gets to me is the HIV comment!  This immediately struck me as a deliberate attack on the Vice President. One that somehow goes back to their insistence that Pence is on some personal crusade against the LGBTQ community. So I started to do my own research on this topic. Well, there was an HIV outbreak in Indiana during Pence’s tenure as governor and he did discuss praying about it. But everything else in the talking point statement is made up by the Left. The actual story goes, in a nutshell, something like this:  Indiana had an HIV outbreak in mostly the drug community. They also had a law against the government providing clean needles. Governor Pence went to the experts in HIV and in outbreaks. The consensus was that clean needles have proven to be successful in combating the spread of HIV. Gov Pence decided to pray before making the decision to go against what the people of Indiana had voted on (no needles). He did so, they dispersed clean needles, and the outbreak ended. 

This seems to be the norm now. A lie held together with a peppering of the truth. The facts tell a story of an honest Christian man who felt a huge weight on his shoulders. You don’t have to agree with his methods. But no one has the right to say this man doesn’t believe in science because he prayed before making a decision. Science and prayer are not mutually exclusive. Unless you are a card carrying member of the church of the Left."
"FFS, Climate Change Is Reviving Deadly Viruses"
"Fifty-one years ago, Alaska auctioned off 179 tracts around the newly discovered Prudhoe Bay. The sale generated almost $1 billion, the highest total ever realized in the United States. The night before the sale Gov. Keith Miller went on TV to proclaim: “We are on the eve of the greatest day our state has ever known. Tomorrow we will reach out to claim our birthright. We will rendezvous with our dreams.”
 
That dream became reality in 1977 with first oil in the pipeline. Oil has funded state government for more than 40 years and paid Alaskans billions in dividends. Oil remains our most important industry and will continue to benefit our state for decades to come if we keep Alaska competitive."
"Fifty years ago, 20 million Americans decided they’d had enough of unchecked oil spills, rampant air pollution, and blatant disregard for human health. Our nation’s first-ever Earth Day was born.

Shortly after, Save the Sound was founded. We lead environmental action in your region, fighting climate change, saving endangered lands, protecting the Sound, and working with nature to restore ecosystems. But we're facing a funding shortage due to the COVID-19 outbreak and canceled events that threatens it all. 

We're less than a week away from Earth Day, April 22, and we need your help to fight for our clean water and natural places. Please, give $50 for the 50th anniversary, or whatever you're able. Your environment cannot afford for anything to be left on the table."

"First Earth Day

You remember a lot of things you learned in Mr. O’Leary’s fifth-grade class. Clearly. You remember learning about the Iroquois Indians and their view that no one could own land--anymore than they could own the air or the sun or the moon. And you remember learning how the Iroquois viewed the earth and its bounty as sacred. And also how corrupt explorers from Europe, backed by their governments and armed with firepower, had taken advantage of the Iroquois because of their view of the earth being free to all.

Since your elementary school was named after a local Indian tribe from the Iroquois nation, one that had been pushed out by European settlers, Mr. O’Leary tied the class’ studies about the Iroquois to a new subject that was being introduced into the school’s curriculum: Ecology. The new Ecology unit would conclude with the first-ever “Earth Day,” for which every fifth-grade class in the school was asked to do a group project. 

To help the class better understand the Iroquois’ sacred view of the earth, and help redress some of the wrongs invaders had done to it, Mr. O’Leary called the class to duty. Every day for the week leading up to Earth Day, Mr. O’Leary, always a practical educator (as well as a former Marine sergeant), put the entire class on garbage detail, and ordered the class to “police the school grounds” for about 45 minutes a day. The class was instructed to pick up all the junk they could find scattered about the schoolyard and put it in clear plastic bags. (Yes, plastic. It was the first Earth Day, after all.)

To go along with the practical lesson of what people can do to help fight pollution, the class was given another assignment designed to teach the students about raising awareness to the pollution problem. The class’ homework assignment was to cut out examples of pollution from magazines they had lying around at home and bring them into class. Then the class made a huge collage out of the pictures. After that, Mr. O’Leary had everyone write a poem in class expressing their concerns about the earth’s largely unaddressed ecological problem. 

You wrote your poem and brought it up to Mr. O’Leary’s desk to show him, not thinking much about it, one way or another. As Mr. O’Leary read your poem, you remember seeing him start to smile and his eyes getting a kind of glow to them. Then, with the same glowing eyes and smile, Mr. O’Leary looked at you. Then he read the poem again. 

On Earth Day, the class piled the two-dozen clear plastic bags stuffed with collected garbage in the hallway outside the classroom, and hung the class’ collage on the wall above them. 

In the middle of the class’ paper mural made with pictures of smoke stacks and oil slicks and overflowing sewers and litter-strewn streets, the teacher pasted the poem he felt best expressed the class’ project, which he had written out on poster paper in big, bold strokes of black Magic Marker.

It was your first publication. And you're still proud.
…

You had never noticed litter before the class’ Ecology unit and that first Earth Day, but afterwards you remember seeing it everywhere. And you know you weren't the only one, either. Because later in the school year, you remember hanging out with a bunch of kids in your neighborhood, you unwrapping a gumball, and (after hesitating) you throwing the clear little plastic wrapper on the ground.

And you remember a girl who was in your fifth-grade class picking up the wrapper and putting it in her pocket.

Pandemic is raging, police brutality, riots, climate change and just plain old-fashioned hatred is rampant.  We all struggle to find our place in life and how we fit in. The most important thing to remember is we are all part of humanity.   No one greater than another, we are all brothers and sisters. All lives matter and everyone has a purpose.  Now is not the time for finger pointing and blame placing. We must all come together and push forward, past the hatred and division. Love and peace and prayers are what we need to focus on. We can do this. We have to do this.  I'm just a plastic penguin... but I do know love and how it looks. What I see right now isn't it. Let's pull ourselves together.   Pablo"
"#followALDI: Everyone gets together and demands that stores like Walmartt, Safeway, Meijer, Costco stop providing plastic bags or bags at all. Every store immediately starts doing what Aldi does and it's expected that in shopping you bring your own bags.

Just how much plastic could we immediately avoid creating and circulating if we demanded this? It's a lot. And just like that it would stop.

These companies listen to their consumers on Social Media, and if the people who pay their bills demand something, it will happen.

"For many years I thought we as human beings must face a challenge on a massive scale in order to push our individual and collective enlightenment forward. I have never thought of this in terms of a negative, although with every challenge there is hardship and heartbreak. I see this as an opportunity to shift our focus from one of negative destruction to one of positive creation. Of course, we are free to view the challenges of life as opportunities to grow so we blossom, or not.  But for me, it is clear the greater the challenge we face the greater the opportunity to grow as the spiritual beings we are.

I encourage us to take advantage of this time to learn some very important lessons so we emerge from this stronger, kinder, and wiser. Here are a few: 

1. We have one earth. We must care for our planet and the natural resources we have. The break in air travel, automobile and other pollution is producing beneficial results, which is a clear signal for us to accept the time to abuse our planet without care to the consequences of our actions is OVER. 
2. The Golden Rule is the foundation of all world religions. It is time we understand the loving energy we call God wants us to live this each day with every action, thought and word.
3. Money, fame, power over others, and things do not define our success. We most admire leaders of honorable integrity like Jesus. 
4. We are the only one responsible for our thoughts, attitudes, words, and actions. God gave us free will. But we are the only one who can exercise power of choice over ourselves. 
5.We are alive to learn how to love and to allow ourselves to be loved. This is often a scary endeavor but real, lasting growth involves risk. Genuinely loving (without expectations or attempts to control others) is risky but the rewards are worth it. Even when we get hurt we have the opportunity to learn and grow. 

We are being asked by powers greater than ourselves to rise to this challenge so we are changed for the better. Let's accept this challenge and know we are not alone - God is watching and will provide all the strength and guidance we need, as long as WE ARE WILLING TO DO THE HARD WORK to grow!  Love you, <3<3<3 Regina Romancing Your Soul"

"For those outraged by the riots...

The Black Community presented White America with every possible alternative.
They marched and sang songs.
They founded peaceful movements.
They stood quietly with fists raised.
They filmed and presented evidence.
They crafted catchy hashtags.
They knelt.
When all other options have been exhausted, and Black bodies continue to be maimed and slaughtered without consequence, the next step is violence and chaos.
You don't get to be outraged by the chaos.
You get to be outraged that it got this far.

Black people are killed 3x more by the police than White people.
Black people are incarcerated 5x more than White people.

There are only two conclusions that can be drawn from this data A) Black people are more immoral and violent than White people or B) Black people are being imprisoned and killed for being Black. There is no middle ground. Either you recognize the system is teeming with racism that is tearing the Black Community to shreds, or you secretly think Black people are more evil, commit more crimes, and behave more violently towards the police than White people. If you have not been outraged before now, you know in which camp your innermost thoughts lie.

If little blonde girls were being killed regularly on camera by an arm of the government, do you really think it would take this many decades to stop it before the entire American population took to the streets with pitchforks? The fact that the majority of White Americans were more worried about their Monday Fun Day layer dip time being disturbed than frequent murders by government employees speaks volumes.

And for those clutching their pearls about the ""opportunists"" looting, have you ever consider that the looter have realized what you have not...which is that their bodies hold less value to you than the TV in their hands?! When that small business is tragically vandalized, there is insurance that will document and reimburse the purchase price of the TV, and the smashed windows, and the soiled carpets. A check will be cut.

When a Black person is stolen by police murder or wrongful incarceration, have you ever considered the cost to the entire Black community? The income unearned, the parenting unprovided, the mentoring lost, the innovation unpatented, and the investment in the community squandered? If in lieu of a check that will never be written, a few people who know how much their Blackness has cost them choose to take payment in the form of a few TVs, so be it. At least it caught your attention. You'll cry for the value of the high definition pixels over the value of the exploited person holding it, just like you cried for the cute little dog being manhandled by a White Woman over the Black man she was trying to call a hit on.

If you've ever questioned the slow rise of Black prosperity in America, this is the missing equation. America's love affair with racism is the constant drain on Black Excellence. The whole in the leaky bucket in the sinking lifeboat we can never stop bailing. Until you let yourself see it all for what it really is...the prison pipeline as modern slavery, the police as the slaves catchers, and the system of mass incarceration as the tool to enforce ongoing exploitation of people of color through fear and violence....you will continue to be more outraged by riots than oppression.

The outrage is not the chaos.
The outrage is that you let it get this far.
The outrage is that you still care more about stuff than us.

A while back, my friend Tim sent me this message: ""There is a World Air Guitar Championship."" That's all he wrote. I looked it up, and it's true. There was even a headline: ""World Air Guitar Champion Is In Finland To Defend His Title."" Yes, that's right: the Air Guitar Championships are held in Finland, the place where ski-jumping is the national sport. Which makes sense...but I don't know how to feel about it. This is the mission statement from the World Air Guitar Headquarters in Oulu. Finland.

""The purpose of the Air Guitar World Championships is to promote world peace. According to the competition ideology, wars will end, climate change will stop and all bad things will vanish when all the people in the world play the air guitar. That’s why everyone is invited at the end of the competition to play the air guitar all at once to save the world.""

""No Birdbrains Here: The Latest on Bird Learning, Instinct, and Intelligence""

Birds can learn from consequences, as we and many other species can:  Baby chicks learn to peck accurately, wild mockingbirds can learn to recognize individual people, and pigeons were able to learn to categorize art and music.  Even instinctive behaviors like imprinting can be more flexible than scientists used to think, and songbird song appears particularly malleable.  This talk will explore bird learning and intelligence, from everyday foraging, to learning through observing, to tool use.  Such adaptability may be critical as wild birds attempt to adjust to the many threats they face.  Scientists also take advantage of this powerful learning ability to help save endangered species.

Biopsychologist Susan Schneider, PhD, has over 25 years of research and teaching experience in the science of consequences and nature-nurture relations.  She's also an avid birder, field trip leader, and environmental activist.  President of San Joaquin Audubon (just stepped down this summer), she was on the Tropical Audubon board in Miami and is a past president of Mountaineer Audubon in West Virginia. She’s published numerous scientific articles and book chapters, and has been a faculty member at St. Olaf College, Auburn University, and Florida International University; she’s currently a Visiting Scholar at University of the Pacific.  Her book for the public, The Science of Consequences: How They Affect Genes, Change the Brain, and Impact Our World (see www.scienceofconsequences.com) was a selection of the Scientific American Book Club and took her on a 3-year international book tour.  It describes the science of reinforcement learning, its important role in the larger realm of nature-nurture relations, and its many beneficial applications for people and animals.  Schneider is currently focused on fighting climate change:  giving talks, consulting professionally, and co-chairing the San Joaquin County Climate Action Coalition.

"[GAS PEDAL] What’s the LOWEST you can ever remember paying for a gallon of gas?

At the QuikTrip on Wilkinson Blvd it was $1.34 today. Over the next couple months AAA Carolinas said the average price in NC could fall to $1.25 a gallon and less than a dollar at some gas stations. 

Oil futures settled at $11.57 a barrel today after finishing in the negatives for the first time in history on Monday. Oil producers actually had to pay people to take oil off their hands as storage around the world fills up. 

For context, the price per barrel was around $60 to start the year, and an oil expert says $30 a barrel would cripple the industry. He said anything less and it would be difficult for the majority of companies to survive.

Fewer drivers on road --> demand for gas is down -->  surplus in oil --> prices at the pump plummeting

The stable nature of modern society, and its governing conventions, seem to feel ever less certain as the pandemic progresses. We can’t help but realize that yes, we do indeed have the means to address this global, urgent matter, which thus far has caused so much destruction, and suffering. The response to Covid-19 is representative of our capacity to change habits, our innate adaptability,  although manifested more abruptly than society is accustomed to. Despite our differences, nations have collaborated in an arguably unforeseen manner, as changing our current, and as proven by nature, flawed approach to infectious disease is urgently expected. Likewise, we tackle other urgent issues we currently face, albeit with less vigor, which the upholding of human rights, women's rights, animal’s rights, fighting climate change, alongside others which for brevity’s sake cannot be mentioned. #covid19 #govegan #humanrights #animalrights #climatechange"

"Going 100% plastic free is a challenge in our one-use, consumer world. We’d like to use this month to shine a light on the plastic pollution epidemic and challenge ourselves to learn more about the issue. As a company, we are committed to reducing plastic in our operations wherever possible. 

Packaging solutions for hair and body products have not innovated at the speed we’d like. For example, it’s virtually impossible to find pumps and sprayers that are not plastic, and we are constantly on the lookout for innovations in this area. All of our products except for our liquid soaps are packaged in recyclable, reusable glass. Those products that do use plastic use an innovative post-consumer plastic known as Ocean Bound Plastic. You can read more about that on our blog about that product, #linkinbio.

While individual consumers can put pressure on the industry with their buying choices, the bulk of the responsibility lies on corporations to prioritize waste reduction. Did you know that plastic production is on track to INCREASE by 40% in the next decade, because fossil fuel companies are investing billions of dollars to make sure that production keeps on pace? 

We need to hold big industry and government accountable. We feel that individual choices are important, but mostly because of the pressure they put on those institutions. Don’t beat yourself up about being “perfectly” plastic free - it’s not your fault that it’s impossible. The best things you can do to support reduction of plastic are: 

VOTE: Learn who values the environment and policies that support it, and don't vote for candidates that support or take money from fossil fuels. 

SUPPORT: Support organizations like the Ellen MacArthur Foundation that are putting pressure on big industry to move towards a more circular economy. Support companies and brands that make an effort to reduce waste in their packaging.

REDUCE/REUSE/RECYCLE: In your personal life, make swaps that reduce plastic use, reuse as much as you can and recycle what you must use. The best way to reduce waste is by reducing the amount of stuff you buy! 

Every step we take to eliminate a market for plastic, is a win. #plasticfreejuly"
"Good afternoon and welcome to our Week-End Update.

Yesterday, President Donald Trump signed legislation providing $484 billion to replenish a small business lending program and support hospitals and COVID-19 testing amid the coronavirus pandemic. I voted to support the additional funding in Washington on Thursday.

This was a critical package as this funding provides direct assistance to countless small businesses who applied, were approved for loans, but could not get assistance because the program’s funding was exhausted.

The measure includes an additional $310 billion in funding for the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), $60 billion of which is reserved for community banks and small lenders; $75 billion for hospitals; $25 billion to support testing efforts; and $60 billion for emergency disaster loans and grants.

As it relates to the CARES ACT, and specifically PPP funding, I want to share a letter I sent to Governor Tom Wolf regarding this program as it relates to unemployment compensation. (Click here to read.) This week, Governor Tom Wolf incorrectly suggested that employees eligible to return for work could remain on unemployment to collect the extra augmented funding made available in the program for those who lose their job through no fault of their own. In reality, the PPP program is meant to help employers and employees until they are able to get back to work. If an employee walks off the job or is offered a job and refuses to go back to work, they are not eligible for the extra unemployment funding. PPP is not designed to serve as a program to keep Americans unemployed. 

There have been some plans issued for the reopening of our economy. The President's plan has a 14-day ""reducing cases metric"" that states should use as a guide as they develop their plans. The President offered macro general guidelines. Rightfully so, it is up to the states to develop a more micro plan that best suits their particular state... very often this should be based upon regions of the state, especially in large states like Pennsylvania where one region may be a hot spot and another region is not. What matters most is safety and business survival.

Picking and choosing what businesses survive or fail is simply a very flawed strategy. Perhaps shutting down everything except essential businesses to keep people confined was what needed to be done to keep people safe. But certainly, at this point, the entirety of a plan should be based upon safe working conditions. Such safe working standards must be uniform. In so-called hot spots, they may need to take additional safety steps (with perhaps even inspections), but any business regardless of what they produce should be able to operate at the very least in a minimal capacity by following such safety standards. They can do so with as many workers working from home as possible and with those on-site maintaining a safe social distancing and cleanliness in the workplace. Regardless of the product or service they provide, people should be allowed to keep their businesses open.

Industries should be brought to the table on how to best accomplish these goals. As an example, the restaurant industry could provide a plan for safe distance outdoor seating as the weather improves. This is the type of creative and inclusionary planning smart states will engage in order to survive without astronomical deficits and bankruptcies. As well, hospitals who are suffering economically should be able to provide a plan for how they can maintain a safe area for treating COVID-19 patients and to begin accepting other patients and elective surgeries. 

In the District, our staff and I continued to work with businesses to help resolve issues they are facing during the virus. Many businesses continue to need assistance with getting waivers to open their businesses so they can allow their employees to go back to work in a safe environment. We conducted a zoom call with Pennsy Supply employees to deliver an update on what to expect as the economic relief projects moving forward. With the construction industry reopening on May 1 across Pennsylvania, this is welcome news for Pennsy Supply and other related companies. We continued our weekly conference calls with Pennsylvania Adjutant General Anthony Carrelli, who delivered an update on the many ways our National Guard members are helping support our state during COVID-19. We conducted a zoom conference with Schuylkill Chamber members to discuss the economic recovery and answer questions.

As a member of Congress, I received a briefing on the economy from Larry Kudlow, Director of the United States National Economic Council. We are currently facing challenging times; however, I have faith that we can get our economy moving again as businesses begin to start opening safely.

While we have worked to address specific industries and answer their related questions, we have also continued our outreach through the media and conference calls with the citizens of our District. This week, I conducted interviews regarding COVID-19 with Bob Carl on “Step up the Mic” on WPPA, Sirius XM Patriot’s Wilkow Majority, WFMZ, 105 FM The River and The Frank Andrews Show on WILK-FM (Click here to listen). Additionally, I appeared on Fox & Friends First to talk about COVID-19 and the Pennsylvania economy. Click here or below to watch the interview.

Additionally, I conducted an interview on Fox Business with Stuart Varney on the Pennsylvania shutdown and discussed why President Trump will again win the keystone state. Click here or below to watch my interview.

I also conducted a Q&A with Marisa Schultz of Fox News on the coronavirus and how it has changed our daily lives. Click here to read.

IN NEWS YOU WON'T READ IN THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA: America is winning its war on the Coronavirus.

President Trump announced another milestone over the weekend: More than 4 million Americans have now been tested. The United States has now conducted more tests than France, the United Kingdom, South Korea, Japan, Singapore, India, Austria, Australia, Sweden, and Canada—combined.

President Trump’s response is unprecedented for another reason, too—one that most Americans won’t see covered in the news. “Throughout history, national emergencies have led to a more powerful and centralized federal government,” Hudson Institute Distinguished Fellow Christopher DeMuth writes in The Wall Street Journal. 

Until now.“For the first time in U.S. history, an administration is responding to a crisis with deregulation and decentralization,” he says.

Here’s why.Career politicians, both in Washington and around the world, have one instinct during an emergency: to grab power. It’s rarely temporary, and it often has little to do with the situation at hand. Instead, politicians create more agencies and more red tape, claiming that Bigger Government will prevent the next great threat. 
 
The opposite happens. A slow, bureaucratic response globally made the Coronavirus worse. The World Health Organization, with its $2.4 billion annual budget, didn’t prepare the world for Coronavirus—it downplayed the risk while parroting claims from the Chinese Communist Party that the virus wasn’t spreading between humans.

Elsewhere in the world, countries with government-run socialized medicine have been forced to ration care, often at the expense of older patients.
 
In the United States, President Trump moved to slash red tape quickly, eliminating outdated rules and bureaucracy around testing, treatments, telemedicine, and more to speed up our nationwide response to his standards.

President Trump knows that Washington works best when it leads, not controls. His priority is making sure that every state, locality, and frontline worker has the resources needed to fight this virus. Whether it’s securing more ventilators or rapidly expanding testing, he’s brought in the full power of America’s best-on-Earth private sector to help. 
These results prove that America is unstoppable when it works together. Nationwide, the latest data suggests that America is past its peak for new cases—and on track to see far fewer deaths than even the most optimistic models once projected. 
 
The President and we know who to thank for winning this war: every single one of you. Our nation’s doctors, nurses, innovators, essential workers, and patriotic citizens are the best in the world.

I want to remind you again that, particularly during these trying times, I, as well as my entire Washington and District teams, are here for you. We are available for any issues you are facing that may require our assistance, we can help make contacts for you and know that the full weight of our office will be applied to help Pennsylvanians get through this crisis.

Please enjoy your weekend. I started the weekend off with my son Danny paying tribute to an American hero, WWII and U.S. Navy veteran Dalton Drake in Shavertown. Due to the virus, large gatherings are not permitted, but veterans and patriotic Americans lined the streets to pay their final respects.  

Playing with dogs is definitely good outdoor therapy. I recommend it.

Again, please stay safe and we will see you soon.

Dan Meuser"

"🌊 GORGEOUS beach, am I right? Swipe to see the ugly truth behind this beautiful beach, as well as many others that are often falsely advertised on social media.
. 
That’s right. It’s sad. However, this doesn’t have to be the future of our beaches (and planet)… If we TAKE ACTION, together.
. 
How do we go about tackling such an immense problem? 🤷‍♀️
.
By starting at its source. 🙌

85-90% of plastic that ends up in oceans comes from rivers, upstream. So, just like with our current crisis of plastic flooding into and polluting our oceans, going to the source of the problem is the first place we need to begin. 
First things first, we TURN OFF THE TAP. Then, we clean up the rest. ✨
.
What we can all do as individuals is to stop using single use plastic. As well, we can practice proper waste management; this part can be tricky, so @ecstatic_ocean_initiative plays a big role in this.
🌎 
We have begun tackling the SOURCE of this problem by setting up social plastic UPcycling systems in villages in Bali. We have educated and incentivized local communities to not only set aside their own plastic waste, but to collect plastic pollution from irrigation ditches, rivers, and their surrounding environment.
.
💪The results have been OUTSTANDING. In the past few months, we have already collected over 8,000 kilos (8 metric TONS) of plastic pollution.
. 
The collected plastic will then be shredded, cleaned, and melted into: 1) Tools that will help support local communities, such as beams and roofing tiles and, 2) Art that inspires an ocean of ECSTASY. ✨

See the third photo for just one example of our many products coming soon!

To help support this powerful initiative, please share and check out the link in our bio 🙏♥️ Thank you x a million. Your support *literally* means the world to us. 💪🌎
We’re all in this together.

"""Growing up I never knew where I would wind up or what I would do for a living. Would I go to school? Work in the oilfield? Where would my determination and will to do great things take me? After 8 years of welding and being part of the oil industry, it was time to take my place amongst The Few and The Proud and become one of the elite. So here I am, West Texan proud and protecting the country I love and the title I earned every day."" -Lance Corporal Kirkland, K.

Through these trying times, everyone is doing their best to cope with the everyday changing events within our country and that which surrounds the Permian Basin. Oil industries are letting people go, people are losing their jobs, and job security is no longer guaranteed to the working class. Though times are tough on the hardworking citizens in West Texas and New Mexico, the Marines are here to help you and your families. We have job security, financial security, and jobs that are transferable to the oil industry for those in need of change. Please contact us to see if you qualify!

"GUEST OPINION -- The Truth About LTD and Transit Tomorrow  -- by Jess Roshak

LTD says: “The proposed system increases access for all in the community.”

What the facts are:. There will be 18,000 people in the Eugene metro area who currently have bus access who will no longer have any access under the proposed plan. It will hit the elderly, low-income, the disabled, and people of color the hardest. It is a fact that some bus-only residents will be forced to move. (Source: transittomorrow.org)

LTD Says:  “Locally, ridership on LTD has declined by 22% since 2011.”

What the facts are: Since the end of the recession in 2015, ridership has been steady systemwide and actually increased in the past two years. (Source: LTD 2019-2020 budget)

LTD says: “LTD recently completed a report that shows the most effective thing LTD can do to affect climate change is to increase ridership.”

What the facts are:  It’s proven that increasing ridership can be accomplished in many ways, including improving route efficiency, speed, providing free fares, and improving infrastructure on all routes. The existing plan will put more cars on the road now and into the future -- which does nothing to reduce climate change. (Sources: 1. City of Corvallis Transit Coordinator. 2. Small, Andrew. “How Seattle Bucked a National Trend and Got People to Ride the Bus.” City Lab. October 16, 2017)

LTD says: “The current system is not efficient and is becoming costly to operate. The proposed system would allow resources to be better used, which allows increases in service including weekends and nights”

FACTS: The budget for LTD is balanced and there is no budget crisis. LTD’s 2019 budget allocated an extravagant $3 million for a new UO South bus shelter (a project UO later halted). Night and weekend service can be extended without the dramatic route cuts. (Source: LTD 2019-2020 Budget)

LTD says: “We conducted over 60,000 points of contact with the community to find out what they wanted in a bus system.”

FACTS: Between in-person events and online surveys, LTD collected 2,500 responses. The other points of contact were people they simply sent the information to in the form of Facebook posts, neighborhood newsletters, Google ads, etc. (Source: LTD Phase I and II Outreach Summary)

LTD says: The public indicated overwhelmingly that they want higher frequency bus service.

FACTS: The public was asked whether “frequency” or “coverage” was more important to them. People were evenly split between “frequency” and “coverage.” Additionally, the public was not informed about what trade-offs would be required. A more accurate survey would be to assess trade-offs such as:  1) More frequency and less coverage, or  2) similar coverage and similar frequency, or 3) more coverage and less frequency.” (Source: LTD Phase I and II Outreach Summary)"

"GV#42: SUSTAINABILITY 
I love animals because they bring the best out of people and help us become curious about the earth and how it all works.

Recently, my family and I took a trip to Belize where we learned that the sea cucumber is at risk for extinction because of things like overfishing. In order to help, we are beginning to start the Save the Sea Cucumber program for the endangered sea cucumbers. All animals bring out the best in people and learning about how at risk the sea cucumber is, brings out the best in me and makes me want to help.

Even your dog can make you a better person. An animal is like a person.

Some animals are big, and some are small, but all of them have a purpose in our lives. People donate thousands of dollars each day to animals as a way of helping them to stay safe and healthy. The sad news is that the reason many animals die is because us humans don’t care for our planet as a whole. I choose to help, and I choose to take care of all that is on this earth so that all things can be healthy and stay strong and alive. 

All animals are at risk all the time because of humans and pollution. So many animals die each day because of gas or oil. This is a human problem that needs a human solution.

My Vybe is Sustainability. This is because I want to keep the planet healthy and clean so many generations after us will live a healthy and clean life.  We can help by not consuming plastics and other unsustainable items that hurt the environment. It is not just for humans, but for animals and all living things.

"Hailing from early ocean exploration “Here be dragons” is a phrase that indicated uncharted waters and warned of potential dangers. 🐉 My marine biology classes all use this as a theme to describe the direction novel conservation measures are taking. 🌊 Between single-use plastic and acoustic pollution, chemical contaminants, overfishing, and misunderstood predators facing injustices like culling and finning, we are facing more obstacles than ever before in the quest to save our seas. 🧜‍♀️ Never underestimate the power of one and how small guppy actions can lead to big whale changes! 🐙 #worldoceansday"

"Happy Earth Week 💙🌏💚 The FRÉ community is celebrating Earth Week from April 20-26.  We will be planting 2 trees instead of 1 for every set sold + a 30% OFF & free shipping with my code MJONES (link in my bio 🥰) One of the trees will be planted in Morocco and the other one in the US! FRÉ has already planted a total of 33,000 argan trees. We count on you to plant many more trees thanks to our Earth Week campaign! This is one of my favorite parts of FRÉ. We give back to Mamma Earth 🌍 For every Argan tree we use in the making, we plant 100 in its place! Argan trees are giving trees; they give to make skin products, they give women a livelihood, and they give to the environment. They help clean the air, absorbing carbon-dioxide and giving off oxygen. This process helps reverse the effects of global warming🌞 Thus, our One Set, One Tree program encompasses our two passions: protecting our planet by planting more trees and empowering women by providing sources of income for marginalized women🚺💟 Be a part of this incredible movement while doing your skin a big favor at the same time 🌼 Shop at the link in my bio❣️ Code: MJONES @freskincare

"Healing soils is the #solution we've all been waiting for. 🌱🌍 If the planet is to rebalance excess atmospheric carbon, then it needs to put that carbon somewhere. It came from underground and back underground it must return! More and more people are starting to talk about how our food system can be our planet's most powerful environmental and human health #solution. It all comes down to how we manage soil. It can either restore our #watersystems, increase #nutrientdensity for human consumption, and #DRAWDOWNcarbon, or it will continue leading to further drought & flood, toxic nutrient-deficient foods, and catastrophic pollution of our planet with greenhouse gases and poisonous chemicals. 
It's time the world understands the importance of soil, and demands that soil health be at the top of our climate discussion. It is the foundation for nearly every major ecological system on Earth. #RegenerativeAgriculture is the answer.

"Health professionals are realizing that the climate crisis is a health crisis, and that their hospitals actually contribute to the problem. Now they are stepping up to protect people and the planet."
"Heat is a significant and growing public health problem in Florida.

Florida has one of the highest rates of heat-related hospitalizations in the nation, and in 2016 Florida had 1112 hospitalizations. Heat is the leading weather-related killer in the U.S., and the problem will only get worse due to climate change.  Excessive heat can harm anyone, but some populations are at greater risk, including outdoor workers. Jurisdictions must work to mitigate climate change and begin protecting the people most vulnerable to its harms.

In this webinar, we will hear from Juley Fulcher from Public Citizen and Jeannie Economos of the Farmworker Association as they discuss the intersection between heat and outdoor worker heath, and the ways COVID-19 has impacted these concerns"
"Heat is the largest contribution to energy consumption in our society. To address the climate emergency, we urgently need to decarbonise the energy required for heat in buildings and industrial processes. However, natural gas remains the predominant source of heating for both the healthcare industry and business at large in many countries. The current reality is that availability of green gas is limited and is not meeting growing demands.

A clean heat strategy is required that addresses the role renewable electricity plays alongside other alternative low-carbon technologies such as green gas, hydrogen and fuel cells. We need to drive private and public sector partnership to ensure that infrastructure and investment exists to meet the demand for clean heat and tackle the climate crisis.

"Hello FaceBook Friends and Welcome to ""All About Vegan"". This page is for those who have chosen to make a conscious life decision NOT TO partake in or support the needless suffering of Sentient Beings in any form, and also not support Animal Agriculture/Factory Farming which is the leading cause of climate change which is also causing mass extinction. Even if you're not Vegan, Please Invite & Share this page with your friends who might be Vegan or those who are considering Going Vegan. My Mission is to reach as many people as I can worldwide to educate and spread the word of Veganism with the hope to free as many innocent voiceless animals as possible from a life of violence and exploitation...

Veganism ""A philosophy and way of living which seeks to exclude—as far as is possible and practicable—all forms of exploitation of, and cruelty to, animals for food, clothing or any other purpose; and by extension, promotes the development and use of animal-free alternatives for the benefit of humans, animals and the environment. In dietary terms, it denotes the practice of dispensing with all products derived wholly or partly from animals."" Donald Watson...

“As a vegan, I'm not really interested in discussing what type of diet our caveman ancestors ate, or whether God put animals here for us to eat, or if we can obtain enough protein from a plant-based diet, or if humans are biologically herbivore or omnivore. These are tired arguments. What we should be discussing is how we can move forward and evolve as a race. The killing of billions of animals every year for food and clothing has helped put this planet and its inhabitants in the crisis situation that we're now faced with. And Veganism offers a solution. Global warming, the declining health of our population, polluted waterways and depleted soil, fished out oceans, starvation in poor countries, species extinction and rain forest destruction are but a few of the problems that can be addressed and remedied if more people embraced a vegan lifestyle.
This is why being vegan is so important...it offers viable solutions and compassionate answers. It saves lives...not only the animals but very likely our own. The human race has backed itself into a corner, veganism offers a way out. Let’s move forward.” ~ Rich Lysloff

""Veganism is of immense help. It changes your chemistry. When you eat and live on animals…. The first thing: whenever an animal is killed the animal is angry, afraid — naturally. When you kill an animal… just think of yourself being killed. What will be the state of your consciousness? What will be your psychology? All kinds of poisons will be released in your body because when you are angry a certain kind of poison is released into your blood. When you are afraid, again a certain other kinds of poison is released into your blood. And when you are being killed, that is the utmost in fear, anger. All the glands in your body release all their poison, and man goes on living on that poisoned meat. If it keeps you angry, violent, aggressive, it is not strange; it is natural. Whenever you live on killing, you don’t have any respect for life; you are inimical to life. And the person who is inimical to life cannot move into prayer — because prayer means reverence for life.
Pythagoras was the first to introduce vegetarianism to the West. It is of profound depth for man to learn how to live in friendship with nature, in friendship with creatures"". Osho...  <3

Robert Adams on Animals- 
""For once you remove yourself entirely from the reality that harms them, you rise to a higher level of relationship with them. You become Aware, and as you rise in consciousness, you will be surprised to find that you both exist in Divine Consciousness. You both are rooted in One Divine Source of Love. You both respond to Love. The separation dissolves. For the separation was of your own creation.""

"Hello My FriluftslivKormos Community! We are people who know the value and beauty of a lifestyle lived outdoors. My family is inspired by our roots in Scandinavian outdoor living values to seek outdoor interaction daily. 

This week however living in the PNW fires have been devastating.The PNW wonderland, mountains, trees, places our family finds health and wholeness in has been burning on a scale I have never seen in my life time. God protect our awesome fire fighters sacrificing so much to save our lands and homes. This morning my family has woke up to black nightime gray toxic skies, sore and itchy throats and an extreme unhealthy air warning. The last few days animals that are looking for water and food but now burned out of the forrest are coming into the area at higher level than ever. The Space needle in Seattle not even visible. I and my family feel physically sick the last few days, headaches, coughing, extreme itchy nasal passages. Our hearts are 💔 broken to see the large of scale of devastation occurring to our lands. 

My feed is not political however under this mass devastation at an unprecedented scale, toxic air quality, I can't leave my house today, have been given recommendations to avoid anything outside, public beaches and parks all closed, toxins all around us for the next few days. As a person passionate for encounters in our environment -WHAT is Happening? We can't get compliancent and accept this as normal. I do realize some of these fire are human destructive forces however WE CAN NOT DENY as I can't even open my door this morning climate change is real. 

Stuck in my house looking outside at a red toxic soup Haze I am a Mother with REAL fears that toxins, pollution and climate change are going to destroy the environment for my children. Do you have these same fears, what can we do moving forward? Share in the comments. 

Stay strong💪 everyone especially all my California, Oregon, WA west coast followers!

"”Help!” 16”x5”x4” 2020 April, encaustic painting on birch wood sculpture.

This is my second collaborative project with my wood sculptor/ scientist friend Vince. I really love the way this one turned out. Intellectual and aesthetic values are in perfect alignment. This is definitely one of my most badass favorite pieces so far!

I have included a werk photo as well as a picture that shows what this sculpture looked like before I started painting on it. (With all the masking tape, she looked quite like a mummy for a while. :)) Vince had this vision of a woman drowning under water - then I took it further and turned her into Mother Earth suffocating from the gases emitted by power, and the plastic waste wrapped around her head. I intended this piece to raise awareness of the climate change and the dangers of plastic pollution. – with Vince Pane

"Here is the first in a series of sculptures I have been working on. I wanted to try a reduction process using spray on styrofoam heads as the paint attaches to the head the paint breaks down and melts the object before hardening. These two mediums were chosen as they at one point were two of the leading causes of climate change and pollution. The head is representative of our planet as we damage our ecosystem it in turn had both large and small changes. I also wanted the process to show the degradation of the human emotional and mental state to where each of these portraits could be seen as what mental illness feels like to the one experiencing it, some of this series lean more toward the environmental aspect while others lean more toward the mental aspect.

"Hey Arizona!  Here's how APS and SRP customers can save money.
It’s amazing to think that in 1921, Albert Einstein won a Nobel Prize for  the theory behind the photoelectric effect which you're using as you read this now and it can even save you a ton of money.  

It's is the science that enables fiber optic networks for high speed internet and your digital camera in your smartphone to take and share photos and videos with your friends and family. 

It also is the same idea that powers solar panels that could be on top of your roof saving you money every single day. 

His idea was simple, when light hits a certain kind of material, you get electricity. 

So in a sense, solar power is Einstein’s gift to humanity.  

The question is, wouldn’t it be smart to cash in on the invention from the world’s smartest genius?

To help you cash in, I’ve have partnered up with the largest Arizona solar installer that has 4.5 stars on Google to help you get a free appointment with an expert solar consultant. 

Your knowledgeable consultant will discuss with you your present and future power needs. 

He or she then will be able to use state-of-the-art tools to precisely calculate the size and kinds of equipment to ensure that you’ll be happy with your savings as well as providing you adequate power. 

Done properly, solar will save you money because you will have your panels on your roof producing valuable electricity. 

Whenever you have any excess power, your equipment will automatically sell it back to the utility company, putting money into your wallet. 

Also if you act soon, you’ll be able to lock in the 26% federal credits to help you save thousands of dollars in 2020.  

To save you time, I recommend that instead of spending endless hours searching online comparing panels, inverters, batteries, labor costs, tools, installation methods, etc. and wondering how much money you’d end up saving, you make a free appointment with our expert solar consultant. 

Our consultant will be able to calculate how much you'd save.  

Will it will be enough to pay for your car’s gas expense, insurance premium, or save up for a college education? 

By meeting with our expert consultant, you’ll be certain to get a fast and precise estimate of your benefits of going solar because being Arizona’s largest installer, they have a unique set experience, expertise, and advanced software tools to ensure you can get the answers you are looking for.

If you decide to go ahead to invest in a solar system for your home, we are certain that you’ll be in great hands. 

You’ll also be helping to reduce our air pollution.

Our installation team will take care of designs, permits, applications and everything else along the way. 

Rather than paying thousands to get set up, you won't need to pay a dime.

"Hey Facebook friends (and friends of friends). We want to know what you think. Please share your thoughts on the following prompt: 

What will be the legacy of #Corona? The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates the global death toll tied to air pollution at 7 million. In a twisted, draconian way, the #Coronavirus death toll might be positive— canceling out deaths by manmade air pollution. Is the earth trying to tell us something? Will we continue listening once the pandemic passes? Could the #legacy of Corona be the pandemic that purged the world of man-induced climate change and global warming?"

"Hey friends, Kirby Trapolino, Founder of Peace Gospel here to talk about #EarthDay2020 and why I feel it's important and relevant to our cause. 🌍

While oftentimes wildly politicized, matters of the environment are of universal importance to all global citizens regardless of your political views.

Especially in the developing world, extreme urban pollution is leading to untimely deaths, increased rates of cancer, tuberculosis, and overall extremely poor health and quality of life which puts children at risk.

In my nearly 3 decades of travel in and out of the developing world, I've heard countless stories of children orphaned due to parents dying from diseases that could have been easily prevented with better environmental quality.

If we put more emphasis on technologies and solutions to preserve air and water quality, just as one aspect of the environment, imagine what we could do for the quality of life for millions of earth-dwellers.

We could potentially avert the untimely death of parents with young children, and stem the tide of the orphan crisis, which is a significant precursor to trafficking.

One could say this line of thinking is a stretch, but in reality, I am convinced it is all very closely interlinked.

And if it's anything that COVID19 has taught us, it's that what environmental and animal rights violations happen in a small wet-market on the other side of the world ABSOLUTELY affects ALL OF US.

So remember, we all make a difference. Some in negative ways, but I hope that over time, we can see that those of us making a positive difference in this world will have an exponentially powerful effect of light overcoming the darkness.

Don't give up!

I shot the photo in this graphic near our farmland in Himalayan foothills of Nepal. It reminds me that there are still places on this earth where we are provided a vision of what a pure Earth looks like.

Wishing you a very happy Earth Day. Thank you so much for your continued support of our cause.

Prophecy of a World to Come or ‘The Equinox of The Gods’ by Aleister Crowley
We all face extreme change : around  the world great and secret forces are moving to overthrow the balance of life! 
Systems of the old world are unable to cope, democracy is threatened and economies fail, climate change overturns our economy and the religions of the past give no answers.
Where is the mind of mankind to turn but inwards, towards our own individual courage?
All this was foretold more than a century ago by the brilliant mind of occultist and astrologer Aleister Crowley.
Aleister Crowley’s secret motto: V.V.V.V.V.
‘By the Power of Truth, I, while Living, have Conquered the Universe.’  
During a time of terrible upheaval occultist and astrologer Aleister Crowley published his ‘Equinox of the Gods’ accurately predicting the forthcoming changes in the world. 
The message of his book is of the greatest importance to us now: a new dawn is upon us, a New Aeon whose quality and character is marked by the gods whose influence now enters the realm of humanity.
Previous ages have been influenced by the characteristics of the Mother Isis (the age of simple human civilizations) the Dying God or Osiris (the rise of Christian religion with its doctrines of shame and guilt). 
Now the New Age of the God of Strength and Joy is approaching and the trumpets sound the march of war…
‘If you want Freedom, you must fight for it. 
If you want to fight, you must organise ..’ 
Aleister Crowley details the curious fate that led him to this crisis, the exact circumstances surrounding his revelation, the precise times and planetary influences at work, the strange psychic messages and occult forces operating around him.
The book begins with a revelation in Egypt, a strange object decorated with the images of their gods, the message of an ancient priest Ankh-af-na-Khonsu. With it comes a text of dazzling poetic prophecy, over three successive days the ‘Book of the Law’ was dictated to him and was to become the cornerstone of his life and philosophy.
‘The law of the strong : this is our law and the joy of the world’
‘Every man and every woman is a star’
Celebrating the power of individual action, of the purity of human will and its complete independence of all established law, Aleister Crowley sets out for humanity a new definition of the human condition, and along with it a new moral code suitable to an age dominated by the struggle for power.
Sweeping aside the outdated values of Christianity, all previous religious systems as well as the scientific materialism of the Western world, Aleister Crowley proposes we adopt our own selves and our own ‘True Will’ as the foundation of all moral and social judgements.
‘Every man and every woman is a star’ declares the ultimate freedom of all. 
Like the stars in the universe we are each destined to our own unique path and the pursuit of that may lead to greatness.
Ignorance and fear have no place, the spirit of man is supreme in the re-evaluation of all values.
Within the pages of ‘The Equinox of the Gods’ Aleister Crowley explains the nature of this new discovery, the importance of its place in a world where the structures of past societies no longer offer answers, and places us in direct lineage with the great forces of divine nature.
‘The Equinox of the Gods’ sweeps away the broken remains of capitalism, communism, socialism, and places us all in the centre of the universe as a powerful and responsible agent of change.
This occult system sits at the heart of his approach to finding the ‘True Will’ of each individual, and it is against the backdrop of world forces that this new age of occult power is projected.
‘The Equinox of the Gods’ is a large format facsimile ( 295mm x 208mm) of the original rare 1936 printing with the facsimile pages of ‘The Book of the Law’ included, full text with portrait and colour plates.
Printed onto archival oyster wove paper, smyth sewn, black endpapers.
Deluxe edition bound in black Palma kidskin limited to 93 copies, standard edition in burgundy linen.
Deluxe price including postal:  £72.00
Standard price including postal: £38.00

❤  Two main questions I get is “How much can I save” & “Does it really make a difference?”

How Much Do Solar Panels Save on Electricity Bills? $$$$

There are two main reasons why people become interested in solar energy. One is related to how much solar panels can save them on their electricity bills, and the other is how much it can reduce their carbon footprint.

Let’s talk about the financial savings first.

The amount of money you can save will vary depending on your house. The size of your solar energy system, its exposure to direct sunlight, and the incentives available in your area, will all affect how much your system will cost you and how much money it will save you.

That being said, solar energy is an affordable, viable option for a lot of people. Most don’t even realize that their house qualifies for money-saving solar panels. According to the Office of Energy & Renewable Energy (EERE.), the cost of solar has dropped every year since 2009, making it easier and easier for most people to save money with solar panels.

If you’re still unsure whether or not you could save money on your electricity bill with solar panels, consider the different ways to pay for solar panels. You can buy your solar panels outright or take out a loan to pay for them, or you could get a solar power purchase agreement (PPA) or a lease.

Each of these financing options can help you save money in a different way, while still allowing you to go solar.

Talk to me about what options are available in your area to learn the possible ways you could save money with solar energy.

How Much Do Solar Panels Reduce Your Carbon Footprint And Thus, Save The Environment? ☀️ 🌞 

Now let’s talk about the ways a solar energy system can reduce your carbon footprint.

In another article, the EERE said that the average American household produces about 6.8 metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions. These gases cause upwards of $167 billion in health and environmental damages. Greenhouse gases also cost the world $279 billion in climate change-related damages.

The point is, the way we normally get our energy comes at a real cost.

And solar is able to relieve those costs.

By reducing your carbon footprint with solar energy, you can do your part to reduce the damages caused by climate change, dirty air, and dirty water."

As a matter of Firefighter safety please read attachment...

Disclaimer: This is all very preliminary and facts are still being gathered.

 Viewer discretion is advised...Please keep these injured Firefighters in your thoughts & prayers!
A very tough video to watch but also a very educational video for all of us firefighters who could respond to one of these businesses. 

We as firefighters are facing new challenges every day in this ever-changing country. Culturally, politically, and economically, to name a few. The legalization of marijuana is one of them and the processes required to extract the oils from within the plant can be very dangerous. Unfortunately, it took several firefighters being badly burned to create awareness on these processes. 

 If ""weed"" is legal in your state than you as a firefighter had better educate yourself on the processes surrounding the different products / byproducts made from it. Please read the attached link above and begin educating yourselves and your company / department on this. We are by no means experts on this topic and are learning as we go like most of you. We also realize that many things were at play during this fire that we do not yet know. All reports coming out of this fire, however, state that significant quantities of Butane were present in a ""Honey Oil"" manufacturing business.  

What is ""Honey Oil""? It is an oil extracted from the plant. This product has several names. Honey oil, Hemp oil, Hash Oil, or Cannabis oil. What's important is that you as Firefighters understand the chemicals, accelerants, and the process itself used in the extraction of the oil.  

Please read the attached article. The author does a great job of describing the 4 processes. There are basically 4 different ways to extract the oil from the plant according to the author. The use of Butane is one of these processes and was allegedly in use in this business / fire. In the attached article, the author clearly describes the use of Butane as the most dangerous method used for extraction of the oil. Large quantities of Ethanol are also used in a seperate process. Both of these substances have obvious flamability concerns for us. 

More than ever, we need to get out in our districts and comb over these Weed / Hemp sales businesses. These may or may not be where the oil is being made. If it is not then get that info from the shop owner / manager. We also need to involve our Fire Prevention / Code Enforcement bureaus! It is totally unrealistic for a station like LAFD 9's to be out doing business inspections all day. The majority of their district is businesses (hundreds) and they are one of, if not the busiest fire station in the country! Couple this with the requirment of company level training and you can see how the Code Enforcement / Fire Prevention division has to have heavy involvement in this effort. 

Again, our prayers go out to all the brothers injured and their famiies! We hope this post helps shine a little light on this industry and the processes involved from a firefighter safety standpoint."

"Hundreds of thousands of years ago, diamonds were brought towards the earth’s surface in shoots of volcanic lava, which cooled and formed kimberlite rock. “Kimberlite is among the earth’s one percent of rocks, known as ultramafic, that are naturally able to soak up very high concentrations of CO2.You can turn something that’s just sitting there as waste into something productive,” says Stephen Lussier, our Executive Vice President. 

“The teams are currently testing how to speed up the absorption process. The promise is so exciting, because together with the other things we’re looking at to dramatically reduce our carbon footprint, we could become carbon storage facilities – as well as diamond mines.”

"I am looking for 3 to 5 people who want to work with me *A LOT* between now and Earth Day to use a step-by-step system to supercharge their initiative/team in the next 11 weeks. 

This could help you make an impact faster and easier, and you'll be helping me write my new book, that will be out by Earth Day!

Is this you? 
- You know that we are in a very critical situation because of the risk of collapsing ecosystems, and you know that we’re not moving fast enough.
- You’ve participated in marches, signed petitions and supported large environmental groups, but it left you feeling alone and uncertain if you’d made a difference.
- You have identified one or more issues in your community that are driving you crazy, because no one else is taking what seem to be logical steps to protect the environment or reduce climate change. This could be something like increasing recycling in schools, getting your faith community to go solar, your workplace to do an energy audit, your neighborhood to transition lawns to gardens, or your city to stop using pesticides. 
- You’ve talked to some people but haven’t been able to get much momentum going. Or you have an existing team that hasn't taken off yet.  
- - You’re getting antsy because you can see the environmental crisis unfolding in real time, but you’re not sure what to do. 
- You want to have a damn good answer when your kids or any kids look you in the eye and ask, “You knew. So, what did you do?”
- You can commit 2+ hours of time for taking action every week for 11 weeks, between now and the end of April.  
- You would absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE to have your team/project launched and supercharged by Earth Day!

If this is you and you'd like Joan in your pocket, read on. :)

I'm offering massive personal support for you from February 11 to April 30 to help you launch and supercharge your initiative or team by Earth Day: 
- 12 50-minute private coaching sessions with me for custom support: focusing, training, goal-setting, connections, planning and accountability.
- Unlimited access to me by email between sessions.
- One-year access to the online Green Team Success Course.
- Downloadable, editable forms and planners to use with your team.
- Help developing a strategic plan for the next year. 
- Help planning your participation in one or more events for Earth Day. 

Basically, I’m offering to hold your (virtual) hand and come alongside you to support you as much as possible for 11 weeks. This is going to make it faster and easier for you to make the impact you've been wanting to see. Phew! Wouldn't that be a welcome relief!

One on one coaching with me is normally $250 a session. 12 sessions with me would normally cost $3,000. I’m offering this massive support for $750, for just a few folks, and the offer is open just for a few days. 

Why am I offering so much of my time at such a discounted price while I’m busy writing a book? 

It's simple. Working with you will make the book better. 

As you and I work together, I can hone and improve my system in real time. Our discussions will help me communicate my message in a way that’s going to resonate better with more people. 

Our collaboration is a win-win-win for you (bigger impact with less effort), me (do what I love) and future readers (improve the book)... not to mention the benefits your efforts will have for life on the planet!

Cool. Right? 

So, if you can commit to 2-4 hours of effort weekly for 11 weeks, and you want to feel like frickin’ Captain Planet this year on Earth Day with your team/project taking off big time, please reach out pronto! 

To apply for one of these limited spots, reach out by Monday, February 10 at 10 am MST. Tell me about your idea for your initiative or team, and why you’d like to work with me. I’ll review each submission and contact you within 24 hours.

Here's the link. Choose ""work with Joan"".

From murderous policing

Rap should be a stencil

It should be a language, fundamental

Rap should be an inspiration

To war and destitution

"“I couldn’t believe it myself. We kept retesting to make sure we had not contaminated or misinterpreted our data and that we really were seeing the capture of carbon dioxide from air.” Dr Greg Dipple is a professor at the University of British Columbia in Canada and first discovered that kimberlite, the rock in which diamonds are found, naturally absorbs CO2.
⠀
Through our CarbonVault program, we are working alongside Greg and 17 other experts at universities across the globe, throughout lockdown and beyond, to explore how we can speed up natural capture and storage of carbon from the atmosphere.

"If it’s on the ground in the Kansas City Metropolitan region it could end up in the Missouri River and then in the Gulf of Mexico. Litter takes on many forms - paper, aluminum, cigarette butts - everything that is improperly placed on the ground. Much of this waste finds its way into our water systems, and into the Missouri River. The Missouri River meets up with the Mississippi River which then flows all the way down to the Gulf of Mexico. Most ocean pollution - 80% - begins on land. What we improperly dispose of in the KC Metro Area may find its way into the ocean.

"If there is one lesson that has emerged from the last few months, it is the importance and power that comes from working together for the collective good. So while we continue supporting the immediate needs resulting from the pandemic, we are also staying focused on our ongoing work and partnerships to find solutions to the global threat of climate change.

This is only possible through collaboration. Throughout lockdown we have continued our ground-breaking work with a team of 17 academic experts across Canada, South Africa and Australia. Together, through the CarbonVault program, the team is exploring how the natural rate of carbon capture and storage in kimberlite (the rock in which diamonds are found) can be accelerated to remove carbon from the atmosphere.

"“If we want to be serious about reducing greenhouse gases, if we want to be serious about protecting the environment, if we really want to get at the core source of a lot of the carbon emissions that are creating climate change we need to have a strategy around improving the efficiency of homes""

"I got a sad and scary email forward from an old friend this morning. (She doesn't use FB, so I won't tag her here.) She's like me - not religious - but the single word she typed was, ""Pray.""

The document she forwarded was email from her alma mater, UCSC - an all-staff alert about the wildfires bearing down on campus, with details about evacuation plans.

Climate scientists, who long resisted linking global warming to any specific extreme event, now say its influence is all but certain. They waited far too long for my liking - but hey! - they are scientists, and wanted to err on the side of caution.

In any event, they are not resisting any longer. Climate change and the increase in frequency and severity of summer wildfires ARE LINKED.

"I have seen a total of one steelhead in my life, but I have full faith that they exist. I respect them, I am in awe of them, and I hope to catch one one day (although I should probably start putting the time in… like now). 

Anglers spend months and years taking one cast after the other in attempt to catch these fish. They know that one day they may find themselves in a position where it was all worth it.

You may have never seen a steelhead, but you know they exist. You may be thinking to yourself, how can climate change be real when I am freezing my butt off every winter here in Montana, but that too is real. 

This election is about survival. Our ballots are filled with possibilities. Of change. We have the power (and frankly responsibility) to save this planet. 

I have never hooked a steelhead, but I know I could. I’ve never had my house destroyed by fire or tropical storms. I have never had my crops fail to drought, landslide, or invasive species. I have never seen islands of plastics in the ocean and sea turtles with straws up there noses, I have never seen melting ice caps and its impacts on our ocean circulation, and I have never seen the mass extinction and loss of biodiversity that is happening. But I know all these things are real. And there are people out there, much like you and me, who feel the impacts of climate change. 

Until we feel, see, experience something it is hard to believe it is real. Or we may believe it is real (like a steelhead), but have a “I’ll never catch one” mentality. Until one day you find yourself stripping a streamer through a river and you feel a TUG! The day we all feel the impacts of climate change, it will be too late. 

This long rant on climate change and steelhead brings me to my final thought: VOTE, vote like your life depends on it, because it does.

"I just made a donation to the Jefferson County Foundation legal fund. They are doing incredible work fighting Rockwool and protecting the rights and health of people living in the Jefferson County, WV, Northern Virgina, Maryland, and DC. 

I thank the Jefferson County Foundation Board and volunteers for their tremendous legal work and courage. 

Rockwool's pollution will have deleterious effects on the environment (air & water) and health of people living in the region. 

Rockwool's pollution will not be localized to West Virginia, it will have negative effects on people living downwind of the site in Maryland and Virginia. 

Loudoun County's population centers, vineyards, and farms are downwind from this major pollution emitter. 

Further, this heavy industrial factory will damage efforts to restore the Chesapeake Bay. 

Please help stop Rockwool from building their heavy industrial factory across the street from an elementary school in Ranson, West Virginia by clicking on the link below and donating. 

https://www.jeffersoncountyfoundation.org/donate/ 

The Jefferson County Foundation needs your help to keep the fight against Rockwool going.  Please support the efforts by donating today, do so for your children's health, and do so to preserve the environment.

Thank you and please share!"
"I just read a Facebook post from someone who wanted to know why we still are talking about Sunday’s half-time show; he asked if there weren’t more important things to discuss.

Of course there are more important things to discuss. We all know that. I think we still are talking about Shakira and J Lo because it’s a distraction. 

Half the people in my town have the flu. Everyone is worried about the coronavirus. The country is divided; it’s like the Civil War. Except the weapons being used in this war aren’t muskets; it’s words and hate. Antisemitism is on the rise. 

The Iowa caucuses went wonky. The weather is weird and climate change is becoming more scary. Kobe died. We need gun control. But the State of the Union has never been better.

It’s way easier to talk about J Lo’s incredible body and whether she showed too much skin or she set women’s rights ahead or back or sideways and upside down. And whether her reversible flags cape and kids in cages were appropriate entertainment or inappropriately political.

We take our distractions and our funny memes where we can get them. Because it’s sometimes easier than talking about the hard stuff. 

And anyway, all that other stuff will still be waiting for us when we are done talking about J Lo."
"💥 I know nobody is happy about what’s happening right now
💥 I know we are stuck at home, hearing the increase of death toll, scared for our lives and our families
💥 I know the domestic violence and child abuse increased in some places and this is not OK
💥 I know some of us feel alone, depressed or even bored

I agree that this new reality is not sunshine and rainbows and everybody wants to go back to their old routine and lives
BUT did you ever think that this was a sign for us 
        🚫 To STOP and reflect
        🚫 To STOP taking everything for granted 
        🚫 To STOP our fast-paced lives where no one never had time for nothing
        🚫 To STOP living disconnected from it matters and not have time to catch up with family, or friends. 

I know it is a harsh way to make us stop, BUT 
💛 Today we are more connected than ever. 7.8 bio people are living the same thing
🧡 Today the families spend more time together
- They connect more if they live together. They doend more time with each other , create games and discover each other
- They communicate more if they are quarantined in a different place. My family is all around the world and we video chat everyday
❤️ Today friends are more connected than ever
We don’t only meet with nearby friends, but with our friends from all over the world via video chats (have house party or zoom drinks)
💚 Today there are less accidents and crimes, 
because people are not on the street
💙 Today the school shootings ceased entirely 
Because this pandemic forced everyone inside (last month was the first March since 2002 …. 18 year… without a school shooting)
💜 Today the pollution decreased and the air quality improved 
🖤 Today even animals in danger manage to make babies
like the pandas in China. Now that the zoo has no visitors, they had some privacy to procreate.

So yes, it is a strange reality and we are bored, want to go out and not be scared… and want to go back to normal…
I have news for you THE NORMAL as we know doesn’t exist anymore, 
it will be different… and hopefully better 
The question is what will you do differently after this experience? Please feel free to share so we can all learn from each other😍"

"I met with Congressman Lee Zeldin today to discuss the substantial fiscal and environmental toll excessive shipping waste is putting on taxpayers. NYers pay an average of $251 per ton of solid waste management and that doesn’t even include our private costs to get waste to and from the increasingly scarce facilities.  Let’s make #longisland the first community to successfully push back and get @Amazon and other major shippers like @Walmart @jet @freshdirect to give consumers a chance to say ‘hold the plastic’. Our island literally cannot take anymore. This is a bipartisan issue dealing as much with consumer rights and wasted tax dollars as with the #environmental cost. I’m grateful for the generous time I was given to discuss the many facets of this issue today with Congressman Zeldin and will take him up on his offer to help open doors to keep momentum going.

Our island can not sustain this onslaught of waste. Please sign and share the petition if you did not already. Link in bio.

Share this post, tag three friends and your favorite coffee company, and join me in pledging to drink Bird Friendly coffee.  

The Smithsonian’s Bird Friendly coffee certification is the gold standard in eco-friendly, organic farming. Most of the world's coffee farms destroy forest habitat to grow coffee in the sun and often use harmful pesticides and fertilizers that poison the environment. Instead of clearing rainforest, Bird Friendly coffees grow underneath shade trees that sequester carbon, fight climate change and provide habitat for native species—including migratory birds. #BringBirdsBack #WorldMigratoryBirdDay #DrinkBirdFriendly"
"I’m so happy and grateful now to be quarantined indefinitely with my 2 sweet soulmates 🥰💖

When life shuts the world down, it happens for a reason! 

Old structures are dissolving that no longer have a place in today’s society. In the places where shut downs are heaviest, nature is making a huge comeback after only a few weeks 🌳 

Pollution is at an all time low; animals are reaching back closer into society than they have in decades. When we don’t listen to Mother Earth, nature provides her own means of restoring planetary order 🌎✨ 

Educational systems, financial systems, political systems, healthcare systems, and old ways of consciousness that no longer are relevant are being replaced in spite of us. 

The blessing is that gentle correction is taking place because we didn’t become aware soon enough. 

In living a surrendered life to what’s best for the whole, you have desires, but you don’t hold to them so tightly that they control you. 

Resistance to what is and attachment to what is not causes most of the suffering in all of life. So why not love your life now? 

In living from a place of non-attachment, you see the blessing in every thing. 

Surrendering deeply into the moment, you see the truth of what is happening all around you. You don’t fight it. And life naturally becomes your friend. 

This is the greatest thing that could happen to us all right now. Choose to see it. 

Choose to make your health and family a greater priority, while society reorganizes itself. 

Soon, politics will be much more unified. 

Schools will teach children things like compassion, money management, relationship skills, the importance of health, and how to create their own reality. 

Money and the financial system will be much more favorable to the masses 

Healthcare will be healthcare and not sick care 

Animals, nature and children will be respected and seen as equals, rather than property. And cruelty to such will be totally illegal to the highest degree 

Elders and our others will be seen as our guides, our brothers and sisters, rather than a nuisance 

Plants will be seen as life giving members of society and fully honored as food and assets that give us our very life, rather than things that are chopped down and burned because they are in the way. 

What is clearly not working will be seen honestly and changed quickly because it clearly is not working. 

Thank you earth for helping us all surrender into a necessary time where the human race recalibrates itself. 

Let us become aware in this moment and make the changes to unite all 🙏🏽

"In 1962, President John F. Kennedy signed a proclamation which designated May 15 as Peace Officers Memorial Day and the week in which that date falls as Police Week. Currently, tens of thousands of law enforcement officers from around the world converge on Washington, DC to participate in a number of planned events which honor those that have paid the ultimate sacrifice.

The Memorial Service began in 1982 as a gathering in Senate Park of approximately 120 survivors and supporters of law enforcement. Decades later, the event, more commonly known as National Police Week, has grown to a series of events which attracts thousands of survivors and law enforcement officers to our Nation's Capital each year.

We want to highlight our Security Forces Defenders during this time. Check out the work our Defenders are out here doing on a daily basis.

"In 2020 the Survival of the Southern Residents Is Up To Us 
The science is beyond refute: Our Southern Resident orca neighbors are facing imminent extinction because of human activities. They are going hungry because of over-fishing of salmon and their waters are destructive with pollution, noise and disurbance. Unlike other orca species, they do not eat other mammals; they closely identify with their home waters in the Salish Sea; they share a highly sophisticated language; they are deeply loyal to their families; and they are the most highly advanced marine mammal throughout the oceans of the world. They are our relatives in their place on the planet. Humans are supposedly the most advanced species on land; the SRKWs are the most advanced species in the oceans. If we do not do everything possible to save our kin in the oceans of the world, we will not do everything possible to save ourselves. It is time to turn the tide towards survival and evolution over greed and profit. For the Southern Residents, it means quiet, undisturbed waters so they have access to available food. Dams coming down and restoration of salmon are necessary but unfortunately the Southern Residens do not have time to wait for these actions. They need our help now. They need us to stop our exploitative ""adoration"" and get out of their waters so they can return home, access food, communicate with one another and navigate into a sustainable future. Let us make 2020 the year of survival for our Southern resident neighbors. Saving them is saving ourselves-- literally, figuratively, and spiritually."

"In light of the CZU Fire which recently devastated a portion of our beloved Santa Cruz Mountains, I offer on my blog - bigtreesgrove.blogspot.com - an excerpt which described a fire which swept through San Lorenzo Canyon on September 22, 1913 and threatened the first redwood resort known as Welch's Big Trees Grove (1867-1930).

The 1913 fire also endangered the neighboring resort, Cowell's Big Trees (Hopkins’ Club House). The locations of both old resorts are now part of our beloved Henry Cowell Redwoods State Park in Felton. 

As we mourn the damage wrought upon our sister park, Big Basin (closed to the public for the foreseeable future), we find solace in the work of dedicated fire fighters (neighbors and professionals) who ensured that the CZU fire did not sweep down Ben Lomond Mountain to all the communities of the San Lorenzo Valley and Felton's historic grove of Big Trees. The excerpt of the 1913 fire shows how earlier fire fighters accomplished a similar feat.  Interestingly, during the 1913 fire the Cowell's Big Trees' resort proprietor, Milo Hopkins, furnished the fire fighters with ""sandwiches and liquid refreshments."" Amazingly, Henry Cowell Redwoods State Park served in this same capacity once again. This time serving as a base camp to feed the hero fire-fighters of the CZU Fire.  

Happily the main section of Henry Cowell Redwoods State Park is once again open to the public. Please note that the Fall Creek unit of the park, which suffered significant fire damage, is closed until further notice. 

The last fire which swept through the heart of Big Trees Grove came in 1867. It is reassuring for us today to know that the redwoods are remarkable survivors and have recovered from many fires in the past.** Because of the CZU Fire, Henry Cowell (open to the public) and Big Basin (currently closed) are now living classrooms to show us two very different stages in the life of a redwood forest. 

At Henry Cowell Redwoods State Park, a stroll along the Redwood Loop Trail (.9 mile) takes you through the site of the historic resort. Though none of the resort's historic structures remain, you will see the magnificent Big Trees which enthralled  thousands of visitors for the past 150 years. 

My book, Historic Tales of Henry Cowell Redwoods State Park - Big Trees Grove, allows you to enjoy numerous historic images and learn the ground-breaking history of Big Trees Grove, the first redwood resort, and how it inspired the preservation of the redwoods.

* What is described as Pine Flat is what we today refer to as the Sand Hills ecosystem located upon an ancient, raised seabed which is home to many rare species found nowhere else in the world.  

** For nearly 15,000 years the Native people of the Santa Cruz Mountains set seasonal fires to expand grasslands to promote the growth of edible plants and forage for game animals. With the arrival of European settlers, Native people were removed from their traditional homeland and the tribes' traditional resource practices were halted. In addition to the impact of climate change, this  increased fuel load has significantly contributed to the devastation of fires today. Learning and restoring some Native resource management practices could go far in helping to restore the health of our forests.

"Invasive Plants Got You Down? Change Your Perspective So You Get Results Without Going Crazy.

Join us on July 9, 2020 starting at 7:30pm for a ZOOM workshop on how to stay sane when battling invasive species. 

After development and climate change, invasive species are cited as the biggest threat to conservation of species and natural communities. Many people understand the threat and want to do something about it but quickly become discouraged by a seemingly endless battle against invasive heavy-weights such as bittersweet or barberry. With a more critical assessment of control methods, more realistic assessment of your own capacity, and a new perspective on what success really looks like, you can pick winnable battles and achieve results. 

Speaking from his own experience, Natural History Survey executive director David Gregg will offer exercises to help change your perspective and practical suggestions for dealing with common invasive plant problems. Some plant ID will be included but the emphasis will be on strategies for surveillance, response, and adaptation. 

David Gregg has been executive director of the Rhode Island Natural History Survey since 2004. An amateur naturalist since his childhood, his formal training is in museum studies and archaeology, and he holds a Ph.D. in anthropology from Brown University. David has hosted documentary videos, published on unconventional curriculum, archaeology, and environmental management, and taught anthropology and museum studies. David is a board member of the Ralph Waldo Emerson Memorial Association and on the Collection Committee of the Rhode Island Historical Society. He works hands-on with land stewardship issues on Cape Cod and on his old farm in Wakefield, Rhode Island.

This event is sponsored by the Burrillville Land Trust in association with the Rhode Island Natural History Survey. The event is free and open to anyone. This event is paid for by a grant from the New England Grassroots Environment Fund. 

ZOOM connection information will be displayed here three days before the event. Like the event, show interest or RSVP to attend. Connection information will then be sent."

It is crazy but some still believe that. 

Beautiful Australia looks like hell on earth now.   I have to admit I’ve cried a bit watching what’s happening.   I’ve also tried to educate myself on their policies.  And to my surprise it is very similar as to here.  A lot of climate change deniers elected to federal office.  They don’t even have a energy plan (which should include transition to renewable energy).  And they have a big money corporate media machine already working on minimizing climate change effects and the action needed.   

Scientists have been warning us for decades.  It is here.  But ignorance is bliss. 

Water, air = life.  Environment affects our health = life.

"It looks like The Stryker Radio Club SRC has wised up. I'll leave this here as a reminder. 

I've had many (complaints) recently ask me about Racist Dave White @ Clean Wave from The Stryker Radio Club SRC. For those that are new to the scene, Pay Close Attention! He's best know as the internet ""Joke"" and newest radio hack (golden screwdriver jockey with magical powers), habitual liar, narcissistic, and a Con-Artist. (too much to list, see below). Not really someone that you would want to associate with or let take the screws out of your radio. Avoid like a crazy ex-wife! It's starting to look like anything with ""SRC"" in it is something to avoid.

His Radios are overmodulated SPLATTERBOXS with limited range, no ears, and no warrant, you have to send it back to the ""factory"" or some other shop after he's been in it. He always claims that it's not his fault. LOL The group that he's in (Stryker Radio) tries to conceal the fact that many of the radios that he's ""worked on"" have blown up just so they can keep making radio sales. It's hilarious but sad at the same time. 

He's the same type of guy that's always ""mooching"" off of another page (even tries to ride my coattails but in a negative way) because he can't make it on his own. It's what TROLL'S and (parasite) Con-Artist do!
 
Dave can't read a schematic, has no technical skills at all whatsoever, or even a real bench for that matter, but he sure can make-up some Really Wild Stories! He's ""good"" at that, and might have a couple of people bamboozled but not for long .. Tic Toc.
 
""TROLL, Maker and promoter of FAKE NEWS"". Any YouTube Channel or Facebook ""group"" that would even allow ""Dave"" to make a post on their page or channel would be Lacking Integrity. ""Dave"" has many fake names, accounts, and even other YouTube channels just to spread his propaganda. Ignorance is No Excuse! 

""Unethical, personal, technical, and business practices Not Acceptable""

Be careful dealing with ""Dirty Dave"", it's a known fact that he deals with stole merchandise, and you'll never know when he might get raided.  Creeps around peoples backyards taking pictures of underage children too, Trust me, there are reasons that I Gave ""Dirty Dave"" THE BOOT!

You can catch up here, and never say that many others including myself have not warned you:

HAM W3VAD, 629 in the Keystone, David J. White aka Dave White - Clean Wave has a dark past, and not so bright of a future. FCC snitch and cop caller.

Racist Dave White .. even his url spells it out. https://www.youtube.com/user/bluegum88 ""Dave"", explain what Bluegum 88 means ,, let me help you, 88 = HH or Heil Hitler. H (X2) is the 8th letter in the alphabet , and bluegum is a racial slur, if you were wondering, and it Turns My Stomach!!

Dave's at the back of the bus, Timmay in the middle, and Mark Rutherford, the toaster oven mechanic ""engineer"" (Mark19960 aka Drama Queen) is the bus driver. Wherever you find him, you'll always find the ""Drama"". https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2Afub32EeQ&list=PLaU30evw85SgvcC01qu1icFtLr7A9tZ9y&index=29 Hilarious .. Timmy's ""butt buddy"" a few months ago. You just can't make this stuff up! 

Remember, if ""anything"" Dave does or claims were to be valid at the least minuscule amount, he'd be able to show (or any reputable shop for that mater) in a video, a Certification Of Calibration for his Spectrum Analyzer, his Oscilloscope, and not some mocked-up worthless ""picture"".  Enough said .. Don't Be A Sucker And Lock Your Doors!

"It’s an easy question that my opponent Mark Ridley-Thomas had a hard time answering: “would you refuse to take money from the fossil fuel industry?” My answer is straightforward: Yes! His, not so much. 

We have the largest urban oil drilling in California. Los Angeles has one of the highest levels of pollution in the country. And, district 10 is one of the most park deprived districts in the city. We need our elected officials to stand up for our health, our planet, and not special interests like the dirty fossil fuel industry. 

I was endorsed by Sunrise Movement Los Angeles and my goal is to continue fighting for a local Green New Deal in Los Angeles. If a candidate won’t refuse contributions from the fossil fuel industry We WILL VOTE THEM OUT!

"“It’s great to know that the research that my group and our collaborators are doing is being translated to the real world.” Sasha Wilson, Biogeochemist and Associate Professor at the University of Alberta, is one of the experts we are working with to explore using kimberlite to capture CO2. 

“If you have a rock like kimberlite, which is what diamonds come in, that’s really, really reactive, it will actually start to break down in contact with the atmosphere and with rainwater...And start to become something else, a new type of rock,” Sasha explains. As part of this reaction, carbon dioxide is absorbed from the atmosphere and becomes locked into the rock, where it can stay for millions of years. 

While we continue supporting the immediate needs resulting from the pandemic, we are also staying focused on our ongoing work and partnerships to find solutions to the global threat of climate change. So we continue supporting the vital work of scientists including Sasha, as they work from home, exploring how to speed up the reactions in kimberlite to store carbon.

"It's incredibly hard for theaters to keep engaged with patrons while they aren't able to produce shows during these difficult and uncertain times. Let's talk about how we can use social media to keep your theaters at the front of their mind so that they'll be ready to purchase tickets and attend events in the near future. People have been using social media to connect and stay informed during Covid-19 with Facebook seeing a 27% increase in visitors and YouTube seeing a 15% increase. Use your creativity to stand out on these platforms, restructure your social media advertising (we'll also address budgeting) and use Analytics to see how this pandemic is affecting your audience. Studies have repeatedly shown that In a down economy the organizations that go dark get forgotten but the ones that stay in the spotlight do rebound more quickly when things return to ""normal"". Don't get left in the dark by going dark.

We'll look at:

+  Best practices for organic posting during the pandemic
+  Recycling old content, giveaways, etc.
+  Best practices for paid advertising during the pandemic
+  How to stand out during donor/fundraising efforts
+  Tricks around creating unique audiences (target competitors and their audiences)

+  Determining audience profiles and where they are in the funnel (top, middle, bottom)

"It was 10 p.m. when Yan Wen drunkenly dragged her tired body back to the apartment. Since she was getting married the next day, she had celebrated the end of singleness with some friends but had a bit too much to drink. Yan Wen was slumped on the sofa with her eyes closed, when she heard some strange noises coming from the bathroom. It sounded like a couple's heavy breathing. ""Don't wake Yan Wen up. Get dressed and I'll send you home."" The man whispered hoarsely. ""Oh, are you scared she'll find out about us? Don't worry, she drank too much tonight... You might be marrying her tomorrow, but tonight, you're all mine!"" Jiang Lingyun pursed her lips in disapproval and out of the corner of her eye, spotted the indistinct silhouette through the shower door. She smirked and laughed. Yan Wen, isn't it about time you gave up? This way, the child I'm carrying can officially be recognized! Outside the bathroom, Yan Wen held back her tears and staggered backwards. Leaning on the wall for support, she clenched the fists hanging by her sides as the blood drained from her face. She had given up a starring role to Jiang Lingyun for this man. She had put all her effort and resources into promoting Jiang Lingyun for this man. But they... had already been hooking up! The battle continued in the bathroom for a long time before finally quieting. Yan Wen lay back on the sofa silently, restraining the roiling pain in her heart. After a while, Jiang Lingyun left the apartment on the elbow of the man. Hiding behind the curtains, Yan Wen watched as they got in the car together. Her heart felt like it was going to shatter and her eyes swam with tears. He had promised to go to the Marriage Registration Office with her! What was he going to do about that! Her heart was filled with desolation and betrayal. Angry and yet still hurting, Yan Wen had a sleepless night. The next day, wanting to know what Bai Zhexuan had to say for himself, she got a car to the Marriage Registration Office as previously agreed. The appointment time came but Bai Zhexuan did not show up. Yan Wen waited in the corridor for another hour before she finally received a phone call. ""Wen, Jiang Lingyun injured herself while she was helping you train the rookie. I need to head there now. Regarding the registration, let's do it another day!!"" Huh…… He said it so casually. Yan Wen clutched at the phone and hung up angrily. When she had discovered the truth last night, she had already decided not to go through with this marriage! Another day? He could keep dreaming! Since Jiang Lingyun was more important than the countless years they had spent together, she wished this scumbag couple many long years together! As Yan Wen exited the building, she noticed a fancy car parked nearby. A tall man got off, walking towards her while taking off his sunglasses. In the moment he took them off, the world seemed to lose focus. He gave off a mysterious yet oppressive feeling, like the aura of an emperor forcing peasants to bow before him. Yan Wen suddenly remembered that she had seen him before at a brand launch event. He was the president of Dahua Entertainment, Jiang Sui-an. Two years might have passed since then, but his imposing manner was the same. His tailored suit showed off his excellent figure, and his whole body exuded unattainability. ""Mr. President, I still can't reach Miss Mo… Shall I get someone to pick her up?"" Jiang Sui-an's assistant asked quietly. ""No need. I won't wait for a woman who can't even show up to her wedding on time."" He glowered frostily, voice low. ""But the Chairman insisted that you must marry today, otherwise…"" His assistant's voice became softer as he spoke. ""I'll give you twenty minutes. Find a random woman."" He ordered without hesitation. Random? Yan Wen's eye twitched. Jiang Sui-an needed to marry a random woman and she, facing betrayal from her fiancé, also needed a man to attach herself to. That would be a slap in the face for Bai Zhexuan! She wanted to tell Bai Zhexuan that even without him, she could find a better man. She would make him regret! Yan Wen made up her mind and quickly stepped up to Jiang Sui-an. ""President Jiang, if you can't find a wife, perhaps you could consider me? My name is Yan Wen."" Time stilled as Jiang Sui-an raised his eyebrows, looking at the slim figure in front of him. A woman dared to say that to Jiang Sui-an! Off to the side, his assistant's eyes widened. Was this woman mad? Yan Wen stood smiling in front of Jiang Sui-an, even though her heart was in her throat. However, once she set her mind on something, she did not waver. So she straightened her back and forced herself to face the gaze of the man with the imposing aura. ""Yan Wen?"" Jiang Sui-an pressed his thin lips together and ground out her name in his rich voice. Yan Wen bravely clenched her fists and replied, ""Yes."" He took measure of the woman in front of him, his cold face not revealing anything. He looked at his assistant, who was out of the corner of his eye and said something out of the ordinary. ""Get me her files!"" Yan Wen bit the side of her lip, hiding her surprise, and waited for his final decision. Not daring to defy Jiang Sui-an, the assistant hurriedly pulled up all Yan Wen's information and passed it to him. Several minutes later, he stood in the doorway of the office and told her, ""Yes."" Yan Wen let out the breath she had been holding. He had agreed! Marrying Jiang Sui-an was a double blessing. At the least, they were getting each other out of an awkward position. There was no need for so-called love. As for Bai Zhexuan, she would make him understand what regret really meant! The registration procedure was a breeze and as Yan Wen exited the building again, this time with Jiang Sui-an, she held a marriage certificate in her hands. Who knew getting married was so easy? The sun was glaring in her eyes, but it could not compare to the aura of the man beside her. ""Um… Mr. Jiang, could I have a few minutes of your time?"" Yan Wen called out, voice laced with nervousness. Even after getting the certificate, she still felt uneasy about his emotional distance. But that could also be a good thing. The man frowned slightly at the formality, the coldness in his eyes thawing slightly as he threw out a careless ""Yes"". Yan Wen took a few quick steps forward and followed him into the car. ""What do you have to say?"" He gave her an inscrutable look, leaning elegantly against the seat. ""I know we are legally wed, but about us… I would like not to announce it yet,"" Yan Wen said carefully, as she looked down and rubbed her fingertips together. ""Why?"" He did not reject her outright, but instead asked quietly. ""I have something to settle first. It won't take long!"" Jiang Sui-an smirked at that. His answer sounded dangerous. ""Of course! You have three months. And I'll send someone to pick you up tomorrow."" ""Pick me up?"" Yan Wen looked suprised and confused. ""You're now my wife. Husbands and wives live under the same roof."" He looked pointedly at the marriage certificate in her hand. Yan Wen thought about it but had no reason to decline, so she nodded. ""I agree."" Yan Wen got off at the intersection. As she watched the black Bentley drive off, her legs felt like jelly. She had not only managed to marry herself off, and to an important man no less! She could not calm the turbulence in her heart, but Yan Wen pulled herself together. Feeling better, she called a car and left. There was still so much to do! Two streets away, Jiang Sui-an casually flipped opened the newspaper with his long fingers. He instructed his assistant, ""You can tell the Old Man that I'm married. Also, find out what happened to Yan Wen recently."" He remembered that that she was the screen queen two years ago and was called the the Goddess of Beauty in entertainment industry. But she retired behind the scenes at the peak of her career and there were rumors flying around of her relationship with Grand Entertainment's youngest son Bai Zhexuan. For someone like her to instigate marriage with him, she had to hiding something. His thin lips smiled as he thought about her appearance. Yan Wen started packing as soon as she reached home. She was moving out tomorrow. She knew that she had been too brash yesterday, marrying a stranger while at the Marriage Registration Office! But she had no regrets; the only people who would regret were that scumbag couple. ""Wen, it's Zhexuan. Are you okay? Open up!"" Bai Zhexuan stood outside the door, yelling frantically. Yan Wen had secretly changed her apartment pass code. Had she found out about them? ""Why are you here?"" Yan Wen remained calm. It was not time to show her cards yet. Bai Zhexuan scrutinized her for a good minute. Not finding anything different and thinking she just had a bad night, he explained why he came. ""Since Lingyun is injured, you need to audition for her this evening. Once you reach the hotel, remember to wear a mask and pretend you're sick. It should be easy to pass off as her."" ""Pass off as her?"" Yan Wen squinted at him. ""Aren't the reporters all aware that she's in hospital?"" If Bai Zhexuan wanted her to be a stand-in, he at least needed to consider all possibilities! ""I've arranged everything. Lingyun's manager will work with you on this. After all, it's your fault Lingyun got injured in the first place. You'd be cruel not to help!"" This role must be very important to Jiang Lingyun's career. Otherwise Bai Zhexuan would not have made the trouble to come to her. His shameless words made Yan Wen really understand how badly she had been deceived. All the times she had rushed around for Jiang Lingyun… That was all she was worth to him. ""Okay, I'll go."" Yan Wen squashed the hate in her heart and nodded. Since they were so insistent, she would put up a magnificent performance so as not to disappoint them. ""Remember to get there on time, and don't mess up!"" Bai Zhexuan said as he fixed his gaze on her. He did not notice any change in her, and hurriedly left to comfort Jiang Lingyun. Yan Wen saw him off with calm eyes. She swore in her heart that she would personally make them both pay! Shutting the door behind her, she sat alone in silence for a long time. Eventually she picked up her phone and informed her manager Xia about the whole incident. ""What? Did he knock his head somewhere? Asking an acclaimed actress like you to pretend to be Jiang Lingyun for an audition? Jiang Lingyun's acting is nowhere near your level. Isn't he afraid they'll see through it?"" She could hear Xia slamming the table in frustration. ""I have agreed to help."" Yan Wen stared at the photo of her and Bai Zhe Xuan that was left on the floor, unnaturally calm. ""You're really going?"" Xia knew Yan Wen's personality. Once she made a decision, no one could stop her. Yan Wen lightly kicked aside the box by her foot, the mirror reflecting her peaceful countenance. ""Xia, I know you're worried about me, but there are things I must do. Help me contact the media outlets. Tell them I have breaking news for them."" ""I used to stupidly care about my relationship with Bai Zhexuan and stupidly believed everything he said. But it's all clear now. They will pay the price for using me again and again."" Her words were a relief to Xia, who had been sincerely following Yan Wen and not given up on her, just waiting for her to wake up. ""Don't worry, I'm always on your side!"" Xia paused before asking, ""But just what are you planning?"" ""He's asking me to audition for Jiang Lingyun because he's so sure I won't reveal my face. So I'll let everyone know who I am, and also expose the unfair contract that I signed with Grand Entertainment."" ""Understood. Go ahead and I'll support you the whole way."" 🔸🔹🔸🔹🔸🔹🔸🔹🔸🔹🔸🔹🔸🔹🔸🔹 Due to the word limit, it can only be updated here Install the APP to search for the book title ""Irresistible Romance"" Read more exciting content immediately"

Top investment banks provide billions to expand fossil fuel industry

Exclusive: analysis reveals lenders provided $700bn to expand sector since Paris climate pact

The world’s largest investment banks have provided more than $700bn of financing for the fossil fuel companies most aggressively expanding in new coal, oil and gas projects since the Paris climate change agreement, figures show.
The financing has been led by the Wall Street giant JPMorgan Chase, which has provided $75bn (£61bn) to companies expanding in sectors such as fracking and Arctic oil and gas exploration, according to the analysis.
The New York bank is one of 33 powerful financial institutions to have provided an estimated total of $1.9tn to the fossil fuel sector between 2016 and 2018.

The data shows the most aggressively expanding coal-mining operations, oil and gas companies, fracking firms and pipeline companies have received $713.3bn in loans, equity issuances and debt underwriting services from 2016 to mid-2019.
Other top financiers of fossil fuel companies include Citigroup, Bank of America and Wells Fargo.
Using Bloomberg financial data and publicly available company disclosures, the analysis was compiled exclusively for the Guardian by Rainforest Action Network, a US-based environmental organisation.
The figures update the group’s Banking on Climate Change 2019 report from April, which showed the practices of key investment banks were aligned with a climate disaster.
Figures show fracking has been the focus of intense financing, with Wells Fargo, JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America providing about $80bn over three years, much of it linked to the Permian basin in Texas."

It is very possible that many of us will have to self-quarantine at some point, so having a few weeks of food is a good idea. But hoarding and fighting over cases of water is unnecessary. The water supply is NOT going anywhere. Your taps will be fine. And the majority of bottled water is sourced from tap water anyways. So you’re essentially just paying for the plastic. (Obviously the exception is for those in cities like Flint.)
.
If you do want to have an emergency reserve of water, consider buying a huge tank that is refillable. You’ll be doing less harm to the environment, and saving money in the long run.
.
Yes, many of us are in survival mode right now. But we need to take a step back and think rationally. How we react to this situation is going to have a long-term impact. Pollution is a bigger threat to our existence than this virus. And acting selfishly out of fear will cause more harm than good.

Let’s be kind to others and the Earth during this difficult time. 👫🌍"
"I would like to share my new song with you all.

Its Australia Day today  -  I have been thinking so much of everyone in Australia and all my Australian friends around the world today as the fires continue. It feels a bit overwhelming to know how to respond. I asked my friends whose family live on Kangaroo Island how can we give and support - they said it would be good if you can come  - we need tourists to support the sustainability of the economy for the future. I hadn’t thought of that … to invest in that way could make such a difference.

It may not be possible for you to actually visit but you can take a moment to pause, listen to this song and send your response from your heart for this situation, to those who have lost their homes, the devastation to the wildlife, the air pollution, everyone fighting to save life  - we know its not only in Australia its in so many places around the world.

Hey Mister is my way of joining and empowering people who speak up for what’s right. The media is the largest source of change in the world we live in and I love that you can use your platform and passion for good. I want to highlight in my song, that with collaboration and community you can make a huge impact on the world.

"January 18 booked 19th 2017 the day of my arrest in treaty territory of the Standing Rock Sioux tribe in North Dakota.
.
.
I was arrested on false charges all because I was praying for clean water and was trying to spread awareness about the environmental dangers of fracking. .
.
I was shot, maced, tear gassed, and brutalize by both Morton county sheriff's and Tiger Swan mercenaries.
.
.
Traveling thousand of miles from one of the biggest sign of greed and capitalism known as Las Vegas, Nevada to a town with out knowledge of who I will meet and what to expect in the front lines.
.
.
Standing Rock was the day I was killed spiritually by police but yet rebuilt from the bottom up due to the amazing ancestral Guidance of both the spiritual realm and my elders. .
.
I left Vegas without the knowledge of prayer being out at Standing Rock has woken me up to both prayer and the damage we have done to our sacred unci maka (grandmother Earth).
.
.
They may have killed my spirit they may have shamed me and slowed me down for a bit. But with the power of prayer and spiritual guidance I will lift my self up and regain my strength and become stronger.

"Jesus said to them, “The kingdom of God will be taken away from you and given to a people that will produce its fruit.” Matthew 21:43

I’m filled with joy when I learn of someone’s productive contribution to the kingdom of God. Living on the West Coast, I am grateful for God’s gift that is life within the ocean and on the earth. But with the horrific fires, my grandson has been worried about global warming and the polar bears. So my daughter decided to take him to a Marian shrine to light a candle and pray. But he refused, stating that lighting a candle would only add to global warming. So they instead prayed twice, but did not light the candle.

In comparison to actions of my grandson, the Parable of the Tenants (Matthew 21:33-43) shocks me. Again, Jesus addresses the story to “the chief priests and the elders of the people” about a landowner who leased a vineyard expecting to collect the produce as vintage time drew near. But the evil tenants refused to pay what was due, and instead beat, stoned and killed the landowner’s servants and son. 

In Isaiah 5:1-7, the prophet laments about a friend who “had a vineyard on a fertile hillside … planted the choicest vines” only to have it yield wild grapes. The psalmist repents, “The vineyard of the Lord is the house of Israel … we will no more withdraw from you” (Psalm 80:9-20). And Saint Paul writes, “Have no anxiety at all, but in everything, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, make your requests known to God. … Then the God of peace will be with you” (Philippians 4:6-9). And so I join my grandson in his prayer for the earth we call home."

"Join us for the award-winning feature documentary ""The Beaver Believers"" on its Colorado tour, presented by the National Park Service. Filmmaker Sarah Koenigsberg in attendance for post-screening Q&A!

Sometimes the best solutions to the biggest problems can be found in the most unexpected places. Meet the beaver believers: five scientists and a sassy, spicy hairdresser, taking a bite out of climate change, one stick at a time.

The Beaver Believers is the urgent yet whimsical story of an unlikely cadre of activists who share a common vision: restoring the North American Beaver, that most industrious, ingenious, bucktoothed engineer, to the watersheds of the arid West. The Beaver Believers encourage us to embrace a new paradigm for managing our western lands, one that seeks to partner with the natural world rather than overpower it. As a keystone species, beaver enrich their ecosystems, creating the complexity and resiliency our watersheds need to absorb the impacts of climate change. Beavers can show us the way and even do much of the work for us, if only we can find the humility to trust in the restorative power of nature and our own ability to play a positive role within it. 
 
A favorite on the 2019 Banff Mountain Film Festival World Tour, winner of the Green Spark Award at the American Conservation Film Festival, and a finalist at the London Eco-Film Festival and the Vancouver International Mountain Film Festival, this film will inspire you to think differently about climate change."

"Join us on e-flux Video & Film Thursday, October 1, 2020 at 1pm EST for Visualizing the Anthropocene: Aesthetics and Politics, an online discussion with T.J. Demos, Toby Lee, Sasha Litvintseva, and Susana de Sousa Dias, moderated by Lukas Brasiskis. 

#eflux #EcologyAfterNature #onlinediscussion #onlinetalk #Anthropocene #LukasBrasiskis #TJDemos #TobyLee #SashaLitvintseva #SusanadeSousaDias

Visualizing the Anthropocene: Aesthetics and Politics is the first of two discussions in the ongoing online series Ecology After Nature: Industries, Communities, and Environmental Memory​ programmed by Lukas Brasiskis, which features 22 films to be screened over six thematic chapters between  August 14 through November 8, 2020 (currently in Part Four).

We have entered a new geological epoch, when human impact has damaged the Earth’s biological systems to the point that mass extinction, of human and nonhuman life, is now a real possibility. Anthropocene is the name given by scientists to this time marked by human intervention primarily characteristic of the burning of fossil fuels, carrying out nuclear tests. and extracting resources of all sorts. Although the epoch of Anthropocene is only 300 years old, its effects extend across locations as well as acquire varying capitalogenic dimensions. Many moving image artists have recently attempted to visualize this ecological crisis—its causes and effects. Their task however has proved to be complicated, as T.J. Demos and Nicholas Mirzoeff, among others, have pointed out. The causes and effects across the planet are very uneven, requiring critical thought to decolonize the Anthropocene discourse itself and, subsequently, rethink artistic strategies. 

In this discussion with art historian T.J. Demos and moving-image artists Toby Lee, Sasha Litvintseva, and Susana de Sousa Dias, we will talk about the films screened so far as part of Ecology After Nature, and ask: What can art do about the Anthropocene? How can films approach industrial and extractive pasts and presents? How do they avoid the temptation to beautify the ecological disaster as past sublime representations have done? How to represent climate change inseparably from social and climate justice?—among other questions and themes moderated by Lukas Brasiskis. 

T.J. Demos is an award-winning writer on contemporary art, global politics, and ecology. He is Professor in the Department of the History of Art and Visual Culture, at University of California, Santa Cruz, and founder and director of its Center for Creative Ecologies. He writes widely on the intersection of contemporary art, global politics, and ecology, and his essays have appeared in magazines, journals, and catalogues worldwide. 

Toby Lee is an artist, anthropologist, and Assistant Professor of Cinema Studies at NYU’s Tisch School of the Arts. She works across film, video, drawing, and text, and her work has been been exhibited at the Locarno Film Festival, Ann Arbor Film Festival, Anthology Film Archives, Museum of the Moving Image (NY), and the 2014 Whitney Biennial (NY). Her research interests include visual and media anthropology, the anthropology of cultural institutions, cultural citizenship, expanded documentary, and cultures of surveillance and documentation.

Sasha Litvintseva’s work as an artist, filmmaker, and researcher has been presented at numerous film festivals and exhibited worldwide. Litvintseva is a lecturer in Film Theory and Practice at Queen Mary University of London and holds a PhD in Media, Communications, and Cultural Studies from Goldsmiths. Her academic writing has appeared in special issues of Environmental Humanities and Transformations journals. 

The Otolith Group is an award-winning artist-led collective and organization founded by Anjalika Sagar and Kodwo Eshun in 2002, that integrates film- and videomaking, artists’ writing, workshops, exhibition curation, publication, and the development of public platforms for the close readings of the image in contemporary society. The Group's work is formally engaged with research-led projects exploring legacies and potentialities of artist-led proposals around the document and the essay film, the archive, the aural and sonic mediums, speculative futures, and science fiction.

Susana de Sousa Dias was born in Lisbon, Portugal. She holds a PhD in Fine Arts- Video, an MPhil in Aesthetics and Art Philosophy, a BA in Fine Arts-Painting, and a BA in Cinema, and has studied music at the National Conservatory. She has exhibited her films at international film festivals and art exhibitions worldwide. 

Lukas Brasiskis is a film and media researcher and curator, currently a PhD candidate at New York University in the Department of Cinema Studies, and an adjunct professor at NYU and CUNY/Brooklyn College. His interests include eco-media, the politics and aesthetics of the world cinema, and intersections between moving-image cultures and the contemporary art world. Brasiskis’ texts have been published in both academic and non-academic media, and he has curated a number of screening programs.

The discussion will be livestreamed on the page linked below, with audience Q&A open via chat.

"JUST WANTED TO POST SOME EXCITING NEWS!!!
The Imperial County Air Pollution Control District (ICAPCD) under the leadership of Matt Dessert and Katie Burnworth, and under the direction of the Imperial County Board Of Supervisors , has signed the MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING OF THE DESERT SHORES RESTORATION PROJECT at a Board Meeting today, July 28,2020. 
I have not been able to determine if California Natural Resources Agency (CNRA) has also signed the MOU yet, but I am hoping the language of the Agreement has been mutually agreed upon.
This is a HUGE step in the right direction.
Our thanks should go out to Matt Dessert, Katie Burnworth and especially Supervisor Ryan Kelley for all the heavy lifting they have done up to this date. Their job has been exceedingly difficult and discouraging at times but they have all stuck in there strong and moved this forward inch by difficult inch.
I will post more if and when I get additional information but you can be cautiously optimistic that the DESERT SHORES RESTORATION PROJECT WILL MOVE FORWARD. WE MAY NEED YOUR PARTICIPATION MORE THAN EVER TO CLOSE THE DEAL SO BE READY.

"KNOW BEFORE YOU MOW!
Grass clippings that are blown into the street enter storm drains and are carried directly to our local lakes, ponds and streams. Those clippings contribute nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorous, which cause unwanted and uncontrolled growth of algae. Leave your grass clippings on your lawn instead of bagging them and it will provide free fertilizer and reduce water pollution. Contrary to popular belief, doing so doesn’t cause thatch buildup.  For more information on how to create a beautiful healthy yard the natural way, go to www. WaterSmartSouthShore.org

WaterSmart is a nonprofit partnership between the NSRWA and 12 towns on the South Shore: Cohasset, Duxbury, Hanover, Hingham, Hull, Kingston, Marshfield, Norwell, Pembroke, Rockland, Scituate and Weymouth. Our programs are based on the belief that education is key. Since its creation, WaterSmart has educated thousands of local school-age children, adults, and businesses on water conservation, stormwater pollution, where their water comes from, and how to care for it."

"Lays Introduces Airless Bags

If you are at all meme savey, like reading about other people's grievances or are a social media complainer yourself, you've probably heard folks talk about their issues with all the air in bags of chips. It's a potent subject. Excess air in bags of chips causes unneeded stress for people across the country. It also ties into other serious social issues such as corporate greed and climate change. 
 
According to Antilies Melvin of the Anti Chip Bag Air Movement, aka ACBAM, “Corporations use the “airing” of their food bags to reduce the amount of feed product per sack, robbing the population of essential nutrition.” Melvin went on to say that it also tricks people into thinking they're getting more snackies per sacky. “Bags that are puffy with air appear fuller and when people open a bag and see all that empty space they feel ripped off.” To which I replied, “It do be like dat doe.” To further his point about how bag air is ruining our society he tied it to climate change. “I mean screw it!”, he said “This oughta get some people whipped up.” More air, more bags, more shipping, more trash. Simple.

 In response to this growing movement Lays will be introducing airless bags in limited markets. I spoke with Zelda Grendel, VP of product development at Lays, about the company's response to the growing social media outcry. She explained that the company plans to ship 1 million bags of Lays potato chips with no air, under the new product line “Crushed N Stale”. “I hope after buying these chips people will begin to understand the need for nitrogen filled bags to keep chips fresh and intact.” Grendel followed that with, “Off the record, these people are idiots. I mean understanding things like numbers and odd abbreviations like OZ can be hard, for morons. Logistics and shipping on a corporate scale must be unfathomable for these dips-hits.” To which I replied, “It do be like dat doe.” Luckily i'm not a journalist and lack ethics, so i printed the “off the record” stuff.

 So be on the lookout for wilted, sad looking bags of chips at your local bodega or feedlot. Be sure to have a bowl and spoon ready because that's the best way to eat something with the consistency of stale corn flakes, salted and soaked in grease.

"Living without waste doesn’t take away life’s luxuries. It just means a more conscious approach to consumer choices, thereby saving you money in the long haul.💸⠀⠀
Here are a few zero-waste tips that you’ll definitely find useful:⠀
⠀
🌿Utilize Compostable Items
It’s one of the easiest things you can do for the planet. Compostable packaging made of something natural, become more eco-friendly.⠀
⠀
🌿Ditch the Plastics
 Instead of relying on supermarkets’ plastic bags, utilize reusable materials while shopping. In case you can’t completely avoid plastic bottles, collecting them and dropping them off at responsible handlers becomes indispensable.⠀
⠀
🌿Buy in Bulk
Aside from saving you money, buying in bulk is a great way to reduce packaging waste. You can take with you reusable containers and stock up on the essentials without extra packaging.⠀
⠀
🌿Recycle Right
Recycling repurposes used materials into new, usable products. As much as this point seems obvious, there are many people out there still not recycling.

This coming Sunday, May 24 at 4pm, Imagine Live Set is coming back with a great cause to be aware of:

The storm brewing against humanity’s negligence has arrived.
It is unfortunate that we only perceive reality when reality strikes… and hurts.

This past century, we, human, built what we called a “better life”, succeeded in achieving amazing things, like melting the ice in our poles, re-routed the Gulf Stream, killed 1/3 of living 
species, created the atomic bomb, buried radioactive wastes into the ground, threw our pesticides and our smokes in the air, emptied mines and polluted the oceans. 
We, human, had a lot of fun, didn’t we. 

Although all of the above will need major forces to reverse the abuse against mother nature, there is something we can do right now against one of the biggest problem of our time, plastic pollution in the ocean.

Each year, millions of tons of plastic enters the oceans. 
Plastic is getting caught in a vortex of circulating currents, impacting our ecosystems, killing fish, causing diseases and influencing world economies.
We need your help immediately. 

On Sunday May 26, 2020 at 4pm E.S.T. join us in a musical journey aimed to create awareness against plastic pollution. Dj Musso and myself will give you 1 hour and 1/2 of our latest House music and Disco tracks. This will be available on facebook.com/house4peace and on each of their Instagram platforms (DJmusso and INRJMUSIC)

"Mia woke up in her room of the student dormitory, took a shower, dressed herself, then drank instant coffee, and then turned on the news:
«Scientists have warned that the threat of a nuclear apocalypse has become even closer. The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists moved its symbolic Doomsday Clock forward 30 seconds to two minutes to midnight, in a reflection of how the scientists view the dangers facing the world. Now the dial is 23 hours 58 minutes, and, according to the authors of the project, before the onset of ""nuclear midnight,"" humanity had only two minutes left. 
""To call the world's nuclear situation dire is to understate the danger and its immediacy,"" said Rachel Bronson, the bulletin's president, and CEO told journalists in Washington.
The ""clock,"" better known as the Doomsday Clock, was created in 1947 at the initiative of a group of scientists who took part in the project to develop an American atomic bomb. All these decades, the project is overseen by the editors of Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, which is published by the prestigious University of Chicago.
In explaining their decision on Thursday, scientists from the bulletin’s widely respected science and security board said that they were disturbed by the rising tensions on the Korean peninsula, the increasing emphasis and expenditure on nuclear weapons by major powers, the absence of arms control negotiations around the world, and the wavering political will to combat climate change.
“The probability of a global catastrophe is very high,” warns the committee's journal on science and security.»
“The end of the world, the Apocalypse. It is as if there are no more themes except the end of the world,” Mia thought and turned off the TV.
""There is an insurance almost for everything. You can insure an apartment, a car, health, and even some parts of your body like Jennifer Lopez did. But the mankind will not be able to get an insurance against nuclear war since no insurance company will undertake such a risk... I will think about it tomorrow, ""Mia remembered the phrase of her beloved Scarlett O'Hara.
“But what if there won’t be tomorrow after such news? Hmm. Then I need to look good today,” Mia looked in the mirror. After a shower, she dried her long hair and carefully combed it.
""I will need to wear something decent, Mia thought and found a blue blouse in the closet. This color perfectly shaded her blue eyes, and as she looked at the mirror, she saw a beautiful girl with magnificent wavy hair and sea-blue eyes. A girl, in which it was impossible not to fall in love with, and her smile was irresistible."

"Moreland city council election 2020 will be a Postal vote election.
Ballot packs will be mailed out from the 06th October and must be returned by 6pm 23 October.

In the North West Ward. 
Unlike past elections attendance voting often meant being barraged with how to vote cards from people near the gate. This meant having little time to digest the information and promises being thrust upon us. A postal election will mean there will be time to read candidates statements, discuss what is best for the next four years of Council, and being able to make an informed decision.
We should all ask do we need a party dominated council? Or are independents able to offer better and transparent representation?

I believe Independents can offer honesty, diligence and integrity.

Some facts about myself

I have lived in Glenroy for over 50 years.
I  served as president of Glenroy West School Council. 
I have hosted community radio shows for over  twenty years and have over twelve hundred hours of broadcasting and listening to the concerns of our community. In 2006 i planned and hosted a Grand Final breakfast at the Sunbury Football club broadcast live on radio, raising over $5000 for Juvenile Diabetes research at the Royal children’s Hospital. 
In 2000 I organised and hosted a Guinness world record for the longest continuous radio program(62 hours) and I currently host two shows on 98.9 North West FM. 
My full time job involves logistics and planning.

- I am opposed to any expansion of poker machines in Moreland, and of assistance for those with addictions to be made a priority.
- Are we doing enough to combat Climate Change? I do not think so. We must offer realistic and optimal assustance to all residents .
-If elected I promise to push for no increase in rates for the next four years.
-The recent proposed two hour parking restrictions hurt those who can least afford them and must be re-addressed. 
-I oppose any further proliferation of poker machines.
-I am totally behind the need to preserve, maintain and improve our parks.
-A dog park for Glenroy is way overdue, help me push to bring one to fruition.

-I oppose any plan for a drug injecting room in Moreland.
-We must celebrate and support diversity in lifestyles.
- I believe we should increase Home Care services, so many are doing it so tough. We must help, we must do more.
Council must enable and assist the push towards zero carbon emissions.

For these and many more reasons along with my preferred how to vote card, to be announced soon, I am glad to announce that I am standing for our Moreland council, North West ward, as a proud independent.
Please consider your vote and help me help you.

"Most people have heard of acid rain which results from atmospheric pollutants, but there is a new type of rain that is far more disconcerting. Plastic rain is terrorizing land ecosystems globally. As the ocean becomes more and more polluted with an abundance of micro plastics, the scale of plastic rain grows exponentially dramatic. Scientists predict that 11 billion metric tons of plastic is expected to accumulate within the environment by 2025. Of that 11 billion more than 1,000 metric tons fall as plastic rain on US national parks. To give a perspective to these figures, 1,000 metric tons is the equivalent of 300 million plastic water bottles! In fact, researchers are now claiming that secondary plastics can be found in every ecosystem on the planet. Plastics are highly durable and they fragment very easily. This makes plastic extraordinarily hard to dispose of. With more plastics deposited annually in to our environment, scientists fear that these pollutants will have drastic ecological effects.

"Most people recycle their plastic laundry jugs and assume they aren’t contributing waste. ❤️

😢THE BAD NEWS: Only 20% of laundry jugs get recycled… 

WHY? Recycling plants are being overloaded… 

More plastic laundry jugs are being sent to be recycled than there is demand for the recycled materials. 

Resulting in 700,000,000 plastic laundry jugs being dumped  into North American landfills. 

Where they will live FOREVER!  

The average person in North America lives to be 80 years old. If we continue to consume plastic jugs at this level…

Then 56 billion+ plastic laundry jugs will end up in landfills  over the course of your life…. 

Enough plastic to completely cover the surface of Barbados twice!   

We can choose to ignore it...Or we can start to look for alternatives to wasteful laundry detergents. 

Whether it is creating your own laundry detergent…    

Or start using an plastic-free laundry detergent  like Tru Earth Laundry Strips.

"@museemagazine asked@me@what I was thinking about when taking this image... here the answer:  This image was taken in Paris, near a studio where I work when I’m there. The guy on the picture lives on this street which I used to take on my way to the grocery shop. I used to bring him food and chat with him. During cold months he would set fire to trash in order to heat up… wood is not present in Paris anymore. 
While taking this picture I was thinking about the ecological disasters we are facing and already dealing with. I was thinking about my kids, and the kids of my neighbours. I was thinking how many powerful entities manipulate public opinion in order to ‘’sustain’’ themselves and their businesses, at the cost of creating more pollution, and how a bunch of crooked politicians feed on them. I was thinking how in return many people actually believe their lies and spread further disinformation. I was thinking how to deal with such a situation, how to explain the people using massively social media to spread those lies with such a persuasion and aggressivity… how to tell them. 
I was thinking of the plastic burning in his fire and that he must be cold. I was thinking that his suit looks good on him and that it matches the background wall colour. I was thinking that he must come from far, or that maybe he was born here. 
I was thinking about Trump and his little hands, and how it affects world affairs… I was thinking that the man is the most powerful man on the planet, but then I though no, he is not. He is just a prick. 
I was thinking of the unrests starting in Paris with the yellow vests and how long they are going to last (they still do after one year) and how much is this the new beginning of a wide spread protests, and if this is the end of capitalism as we know it. It must be. It has to be. Monarchies all over Europe crumbled after the French revolution started. 
I was thinking of the changes we will have to deal with and how much of this adaptation will be managed in a short term. I was thinking of how we will face many migratory problems in the near future because of climate change and how the growing world-wide population will affect all what we love."

Storm Surge is about the anxiety we all feel in these uncertain times. With the global pandemic, racism and the continuing struggles for social justice, climate change, political upheaval, economic turmoil, and a future of uncertainty, there is a storm that’s raging inside of us right now.

Storm Surge
By Joe Deninzon, Friederich Burgmüller, Michael Sadler, and Jason Gianni

Tangled emotions
waves pound the oceans
wild winds fill my slumber
darkness pulls me under

Caught in a storm surge
shackled and submerged 
restless dreams they haunt me
drowning in this mad sea

The storm raging inside me
I reach for you but I can’t breath
mouth wide open I can’t scream
my life flashing by me

The storm raging inside me
tidal waves that surround me
every night it’s the same dream
drowning in this mad sea"

"My heart aches for this Planet. ""Since 1950, the world has created 6.3 trillion kilograms of plastic waste — and 91 percent has never been recycled even once, according to a landmark 2017 study published in the journal Science Advances. Unlike aluminum, which can be recycled again and again, plastic degrades in reprocessing, and is almost never recycled more than once. A plastic soda bottle, for example, might get downcycled into a carpet. “Recycling delays, rather than avoids, final disposal,” the Science authors write. And most plastics persist for centuries."""

"“My passion for environmental advocacy began in middle school after I witnessed the devastating effect pollution was having on my parents’ home country, Iran. Severe air pollution in Iran has turned into a major public health crisis, with nearly 30,000 Iranians dying yearly as a result of air pollution. Air pollution is exacerbated by climate change, so as the youngest member on the inaugural United Nations Secretary-General’s Youth Advisory Group on Climate Change, I hope to advocate for a strong climate strategy that will ensure clean air for all.” -  Sophia Kianni

————————————— This project was initially conceived back in 2017 on a trip to LA. I wanted to create a project speaking on Water, and specifically the importance of Water Equity. In the midst of this Global COVID-19 Pandemic, we must not forget the impact of access to Clean Water, something that should be a right for all. A key way of minimizing risk of infection is washing hands thoroughly and frequently. What about the roughly 40% of the world already dealing with water stress and those that don’t have access to clean water? The reality is Water is a resource that is becoming increasingly more scarce , exacerbated by climate change, coupled with growing population and demand. There are steps we can take to help, and this organization @gravitywater is taking a unique approach to capturing and filtering rainwater, in a way that is safe for drinking ! —————————————

She is having to balance the gusher of cash coming from the oil and natural gas industry with a blue state constituency that is largely hostile to the industry.

Lujan-Grisham is a big believer as well, but she must also manage relationships with an industry that is giving the state a massive infusion of prosperity."

"Not hard to understand. There are more than a few Americans that feel the same way about Mr. Trump as well as various Iranian leaders over the years.

As someone who spent their entire childhood and youth growing up in Europe, north Africa, east Africa and the Middle East, and who has closely followed our Middle Eastern relations for decades, I have come to my own conclusions about Iran.￼￼ Of all the peoples in the Middle East, the Iranians are a monks the most educated and cultured. Their nation is largely devoid of some of the deeply tribal factions that other nations live with. While it is currently hard to complement their government and particularly the theocratic oversight, it is at least not a government of a repressive monarchy.

We have made mistakes with the Iranians, most notably the CIA engineered overthrow of their government between 1951 and 1953. This would also include support of if not the installation of Mohammad Reza Pavlovi as the autocratic and corrupt ruler he was￼￼￼. Really the abundance of American officials from our vice president on down and leaders of industry and finance that attended his bogus coronation in 1967 are people that should’ve had their heads examined.￼  no different then as we often see you today, they were people deeply ignorant of, indifferent and oblivious to￼ Pahlavi’s true nature. After all, the tents, the accommodations and the abundance of caviar we’re just so good.

The Iranians have not been blameless, the overthrow of the Shah was understandable but did not require the overrunning of our embassy or the imprisonment of so many of the staff and other Americans for well over a year.￼￼￼  While some restraint was apparent and the captives were not harmed, there could’ve been more restraint and more of a pursuit of dialogue.￼  Of course that is a two party effort and Americans can be as thick skulled as any￼, including Iranians, and highly reluctant to admit fault, to admit poor judgement even of former authorities.￼￼￼

As an American, I have long argued that our Middle East policy￼ has been one blunder after another for decades. It is been policy conceived, not in the interest of Americans, but largely in the interest of the oil industry. It is long past time and there is no better time than now, when carbon fuels are becoming increasingly irrelevant, to break with this unfortunate history.  We should be pursuing the most cordial and transparent relations with Iranians and others. It should be a sort of relations that are built on mutual interest and not the overwhelming use force that is our history.  If that sounds optimistic, it is. But then, I have long argued that were it not for greed and corruption within the Israeli government, the Israelis and the Palestinians could have enjoyed a relationship every bit ￼￼￼as trusting and mutually beneficial as the relationship between the United States and Canada.￼￼

The United States is 242 years old and has been at war for all but 16 of those years. President Carter spelled it out very clearly; VR the most warlike nation on the planet. There are a number of reasons for this, none very defensible, it is time that, as supposedly leaders of the free world, we set a better example.￼￼￼  To do so, we will need to end the corruption in and of our own government￼."

"ONLY 10 ARE NEEDED 

That is corrrect.

ONLY 10 HOSTS ARE NEEDED TO CLEAN THE AIR OF BAKERSFIELD
 
The American Lung Association has classified Bakersfield, California, as the city with the most contaminated air in the nation.(http://www.stateoftheair.org/city-rankings/most-polluted-cities.html)

The non-profit association Urban Lung would like to change that by cleaning the ambient air of Bakersfield!
 
To do it we need the help of only 10 property owner's in Bakersfield, who would like to participate in Urban Lung´s drive to clean the air in your city by hosting for a year one of our patented Kinetic Lungs on your property.

That's it!

Look at what we have achieved in Mexicali, which was considered one of the the most contaminated cities in Mexico until 2019
 
One year after we installed our network of Kinetic Lungs, we've reduced the contamination in Mexicali from 87% of the time, to only 18.2% (Source: the Mexican Federal Agency of clean air SINAICA)
 
Just as in Mexicali a year ago, Bakersfield today is the number one in particle pollution!

Our patented system (US Patent 10406466) is the most advanced in the world. It is the fist technology that purifies the ambient air without filters of any type that contaminate the land, and without generating any gases that contaminate the air: the Kinetic Lung uses only ecological means to capture toxic particles and gasses. We use solar energy to power the ventilators that circulate 50 thousand cubic METERS of air in a single 12 hour day with each Kinetic Lung, (yes, that is 1,765,733 cubic feet per day and per Lung!) and we use kinetic energy to purify the air inside each cell.
 
As a reference, Kinetic energy is the same one that allows planes to fly.
 
The Kinetic Lung is completely autonomous and safe. It is almost completely quiet, and it doesn't require any activity from the hosts. We do the periodic maintenance and take care of everything, so the hosts don't have to worry about anything.
 
You can read all about Urban Lung technology and our stories of success cleaning the air of the urban areas in our site:

"PART 1
US and Iran: What Went Wrong?

We do not have to go to far back to understand how things got awry between US and Iran. This blog is Part 1 of a 3 part series on US-Iran relations and repercussions for the World.
1. Iran is the only Shia nation in the world and the Sunni-Shia divide and animosity goes back to the 7th century AD. As such Shia Islam is not only the Iranians sense of pride and uniqueness but also a sense of isolation from the rest of the Islamic states.
2. Iranians are extremely proud of their heritage and revel in the fact that they once were a rich civilization, educated and erudite with an empire that stretched from Egypt to Central Asia. 
3. From 18th century onwards a weakened Iranian state fell prey to the machinations of countries such as Russia, and England. The Anglo-Russian Agreement of 1907 carved the country into thirds, with Russia in complete control of the Northern areas, England in control of the Southern areas and the middle left to the Shah regime. Both these countries appropriated sizable chunks of Iranian oil revenues that continued into the second world war. Repeated failed harvests and widespread famine made life extremely difficult for the average Iranian. By 1946, Iran was one of the poorest countries in the world.
4. To compound the problem was a corrupt and extractive Qajar regime that literally gave away the country’s wealth and resources to foreign powers in the form of monopolies and lax tariffs in exchange for loans from foreign banks to fuel their life of excess.
5. A highly educated but restive population was well aware of the extractive and toxic domestic and international situation and was ready to bring about the much-needed revolutionary change. There was growing passion and movement among the intellectuals to adopt the constitutionally limited form of government that United States had and get rid of the hated Shah regime.  
 
Cold War, Containment and the United States (1946-1977)

6. Post World War II and the advent of the Cold War saw increased involvement of the United States in Iranian Domestic politics first to prevent Iran from becoming communist and falling into Soviet Union’s sphere of influence and secondly to secure the much-needed supply of Oil.  In order to contain the Soviet Union US signed a mutual defense agreement with Iran which provided military and financial aid for development. Iranians were generally pleased with US support and welcomed the Truman administration’s mediation with the British and the AIOC that were together siphoning off majority of the Iranian oil revenue. Incensed with the fact that the Iranian parliament had voted to nationalize the oil industry, the British enforced a blockade of Iran’s oil exports and were ready to invade the nation. Alarmed, the US delivered a strong warning to the British and supported the Iranian nationalization of the oil industry much to the chagrin of the British.
7. The man leading Iran during this crisis was Dr. Mohammad Mosaddeq a leader that the United States supported initially. Mosaddeq and the Iranians sincerely thought that the anti-colonialist and anti-imperialist US would continue to support the Iranians against the British. But the US position became complicated due to the advent of the Korean War and British pressure that the later would support US only if US stayed out of Iran. 

What Went Wrong? 

8. Coup d’etat Against a Popularly Elected Leader: The resultant was operation Ajax, a CIA covert program to topple the Mosaddeq government and destabilize Iran. Understanding that fissures had been created within the political system and the society by the US and England, and that he might be ousted, Mosaddeq called for a referendum to dissolve the parliament which he preceded to do so as he won the referendum with more than 99% of the votes. In retaliation US cancelled the much needed economic assistance to Iran. To top it off CIA instigated a coup d’etat against Mosaddeq. 
9. US support for the unpopular Shah regime: Iranians believed that the US encouraged Shah to buy their arms, pushed towards economic policies that were detrimental to the people, and helped the secret police SAVAK to oppress the Iranian people. The people were also painfully aware that the immense oil revenue was benefitting them the least.
10. Curb on religious freedom by the Shah regime: There was also a growing resentment among the people that the regime’s oppressive curb on their religious freedom was also supported by United States. Blame the West became the mantra among the middle class. This was fomented by the clergy especially their spiritual leader Ayatollah Khomeini who instilled among the people that America ‘the great Satan’ was responsible for ‘westernization’ of Iran and must be evicted from the country.

The stage was set for discontent and distrust toward the United States!"
"Passionate Promoter of Environment and Climate Change"
"Pastor Powell Believes…
The Congressional candidate’s view on the Issues of Today. 
20/20 Vision: Clear Policy positions of 
United States Congressional candidate Rev. Mark J. Powell, M.Div. (D-IN 9)

“America’s political managers are apparently in the fog of placation and not statesmen of character and courage who love the United States. That ends in 2020 with this candidacy and, God willing, the election of a strong moral voice for America on November 3rd.”  ~ United States Congressional candidate Rev. Mark J. Powell, M.Div. (D-IN 9)  02/02/2020

Economic Justice:
The wage gap has become a monumental problem in the United States, as is rising homelessness and poverty. 
Pastor Powell believes and will support…
1. Legislation that offers housing programs to the homeless, decriminalizing homelessness, community job programs and a focus on a social safety net to keep our veterans, families, and individuals from becoming homeless and give a hand up to fit whatever their unique situation may be.
2. Supporting a livable wage. No one should be working full-time in America and living in poverty.
3. Supporting low-income housing, financial aid, job training programs and small business grant programs
4. New job creation in rural areas in industries that are booming.
5. Fully funding our social safety net programs such as WIC, food stamps, disability and mental health services. Those who can work need a sliding scale of services to help
them get back on their feet or supplement poverty-wages. Those who cannot work should not have to worry if they can feed their family.

“If there is a poor person among your brothers (and sisters) in any of the towns of the land that the Lord your God is giving you, do not be hardhearted or tightfisted toward your poor neighbor.”  Deuteronomy 15:7

Immigration:
This nation was built on immigration. We need comprehensive reform that is fair, safe and moral with compassion at its center. Pastor Powell rejects the scapegoating and the fear 
mongering of immigrants and refugees or supports the policies of the Trump administration and family separation. Pastor Powell’s birth father was an immigrant from Poland after surviving World War II, he personally knows we need immigration reform. But reform needs to take place with the governing hand of compassion. 

       Pastor Powell believes and will support…
1. Protect “Dreamers” and make DACA permanent.
2. Make it easier for people to enter legally and apply for citizenship by following our
laws/rules, and to make it possible for those who are already here illegally to apply for
status and begin paying taxes and living here legally. Except for a history of violent criminal offenses or gang activity, there is no reason for deportation of immigrants who have been here for decades – we must provide a way for them to come out of the shadows instead.
3. Stop illegal narcotics and human trafficking and create a more secure border with better technology and increased personnel by targeting venomous criminals and crooked governments instead of frightened families and innocent children fleeing violence.
4. Stop the mass-deportation force, increased authority and harsh practices of ICE.
These goals line up with ours as Christians. The hate exhibited against immigrants must stop. Except for our Native American brothers and sisters (which is a policy paper in itself), we are all immigrants.
 
“When a foreigner lives with you in your land, do not mistreat him. The foreigner living with you must be treated as one of your native-born. Love them as yourself, for you were foreigners in Egypt. I am the Lord your God.”  Leviticus 19:33-34

Environmental Protections:
Global warming is real, and we are seeing more and more affects of it every year. The only debate on what we will do to act responsibly. Logic commands us to take care of the earth and all creation. You and I are responsible for this crisis and in so many ways we have failed. Pastor Powell supports government action and personal action to care for our planet and to protect and treat animals humanely and respectfully.

         Pastor Powell believes and will support…
1. Immediate Action to create the United States Department of the Environment
 2. Reducing greenhouse gas emissions
 3. Protecting our forests, national parks and arctic regions worldwide by investing in environmentally compassionate technology and jobs
 4. Humane treatment of animals, a national animal rights ethics code that is stronger, and funding for better systems of animal control, adoption and tighter regulation on
 the meat and other industries for humane treatment.
 5. Reinstating the restrictions against ivory, puppy mills and hunting that the Trump  Administration rolled back!!!

“A generation goes, and a generation comes, but the earth remains forever. The sun rises, and the sun goes down, and hastens to the place where it rises. The wind blows to the south and goes around to the north; around and around goes the wind, and on its circuits the wind returns. All streams run to the sea, but the sea is not full; to the place where the streams flow, there they flow again. There is no remembrance of former things, nor will there be any remembrance of later things yet to be among those who come after.” Ecclesiastes 1:4-7,11.

Health Insurance Reform:

Health insurance coverage is not a RIGHT for the elite, wealthy or Congress, it is a human right. A free market should not be able to dictate who is more worthy of living or dying due to lack of needed treatment and care.  Quality care, required medication and medical services (including preventative care, dental health, prenatal/maternal care and mental health care) must be available to every person in this country regardless of status, past medical history or income level.

                                   Pastor Powell believes…

1. Due to this domestic Emergency, Pastor Powell will sponsor legislation in January that will state: beginning July 1, 2021 all citizens earning a household income of $99,999 or less will have immediate access to Congressional Health Insurance. Pastor Powell believes this enacted legislation will motivate all Representatives and Senators to ACT on this issue immediately. 

“Behold, I will bring to it health and healing, and I will heal them and reveal to them abundance of prosperity and security.” Jeremiah 33:6

Criminal Justice Reform:

America needs a complete overhaul of our criminal justice system, from the overpopulation of our prisons to abolishment of the death penalty

       Pastor Powell believes and will support…

1. Focus on rehabilitation, not harsh punishment.  
2. The total elimination of the use of torture or inhumane treatment of prisoners for any reason at home or abroad.
3. Mercy and value rehabilitation, when possible, over harsh punishment. This means advocating for humane treatment of prisoners, lesser prosecution for drug and minor arrests and favoring rehabilitation over long prison sentences unless public safety is at risk. Pastor Powell supports increased budgets for joint FBI, DEA, DIA, DHS, CIA and Special Forces  anti-gang and international political corruption task forces commanded by the Secretary of Homeland Security and reporting directly to the President of the United States.   
4. The absolute abolishment of the death penalty.  
5. The immediate elimination of private prisons have led to mass fraud and abuse. Americans are the most over-incarcerated people in the world and this disproportionately affects minorities and the poor. THAT is not justice and needs to be overhauled.
6. That any law enforcement officer and member  of the United States military who commits crimes are held accountable and that proper training and funding is provided to every police district and military base. 
 
“Remember those in prison as if you were their fellow prisoners, and those who are mistreated
as if you yourselves were suffering.”  Hebrews 13:3

Firearm Safety:

Children, country music fans, the LGBTQ community, college students, worshipers at Church…have been victims of the mindless menace of violence which affects us ALL and it ought to bring us together across partisan lines for common sense reforms. More than half of Americans – both Democrats and Republicans – support firearm safety by keeping guns out of the hands of the mentally ill and broader background checks without gun show loopholes. 

Please know Pastor Powell is for the People keeping their firearms and that includes handguns and long barreled weapons. 

Why? 

Pastor Powell’s father Joseph was born in Kielce, Poland in 1928. He was 11 when the National Socialists (Nazis) invaded and 16 when the Stalinist Communist Socialists took over after the Nazis. It was a miracle Joseph survived the Displaced Persons camps and came to the United States via the Port of New Orleans and to Chicago where he met and married Pastor Powell’s mother. When pastor was a small boy his father told him there was no difference between the Socialists…Nazi or Communist…they both outlawed private gun ownership and the people were at the mercy of the merciless. So not on Pastor Powell’s watch will Second Amendment Rights be abridged.  

Pastor Powell believes and will support…
1. Any common-sense firearm safety legislation such as expanded background checks, keeping guns out of the hands of criminals and severely mentally ill, closing the gun show loopholes.

“Teach us to number our days that we may gain a heart of wisdom.” Psalm 90:12

"People all over the world are already being affected by a warmer world. What should the plan to address climate change look like? I write about two key strategies in this year’s annual letter."
"People do not always consider Covid-19 corona virus an Environmental issue.
But pandemics are issues. SO are heat, water shortages, drought,dust bowls desertification,Earth ecosystem degradation,endangered species,loss of keystone species,biodiversity, and population distribution.
Access to water is a global health issue because lack of water that is safe for drinking and sanitation is Earth's largest cause of illness.  Water is a national and global security issue because of access to shared water resources between nations.  Water is an Environmental issue because excessive withdrawal of water result in lower water tables,lower river flows,shrinking lakes,declining water quality and degradation of ecosystem services provided by aquatic systems.  
          Earth's hydrological cycle the movement of water in seas,in the air, and on the land driven by solar energy and gravity...water recycling and purification works well unless
overload with wastes or water withdrawn from
 underground and surface waters faster than it is replenished.  We interfere with hydrological cycle when we cut down forests,water sheds,or by global warming that alters the distribution patterns and alters cycle rate."
"People spend about 90% of their lives indoors, and pollutant levels can be as high as 100 times the levels encountered outside. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) ranks indoor air pollution among the top four environmental hazards in America. COVID-19 is a AIRBORNE Virus. 

While our attention is focused on the spread of Coronavirus, and we are thinking about the necessary precautions that are needed to reduce our chances of coming in contact with this virus, HVAC professionals know that Coronavirus is not the only disease, germ, virus, or pollutant we need to combat in our homes. We also need to consider the other viruses and germs that are spread through a central HVAC system. One-way people can be proactive and protect themselves from getting sick in general is by being educated on Indoor Air Quality (IAQ).

There are four particular groups (although all people could benefit) that need the best possible air quality in the home:

Infants to 16-years-old
Adults, age 60 plus
No age restriction - immune-compromised individuals, pregnant women, and persons with chronic respiratory disorders, and those recovering from surgical procedures or illness
Pet owners with domestic animals - dogs, cats, and birds
Scientist believes the principal transmission mode of the Coronavirus is by respiratory droplets, which may travel several feet from someone who is coughing or sneezing. Covering your mouth when you cough or sneeze is the first step to control the spread. However, residual contaminants can travel through your HVAC system, where all air in the home is circulated and can contribute to the spread of an airborne virus. The Coronavirus has the same traits as other viruses such as the common cold, the flu, and a sore throat, by how it is spread from person-to-person.

Another issue: the wasted water that goes into producing plastic. It takes water to both produce plastic, and water is also used to reduce the pollution caused by plastic production. On UN-Water's #WorldWaterDay we're thinking about how to use less water, which also means using less plastic. Learn more about the water footprint of plastic: http://ow.ly/e3bM50ySp0b"

"🚫⛔ Please don't put junk mail in the garbage.  Read more..... Irresponsible thing to do: 
Putting junk or paper mail in the garbage is really bad for the environment as it does not let the sender know you don't want it.

Responsible thing to do:

By law, you can ask mail solicitors to stop sending you junk mail and they are required to honor that request. ♻️ While recycling paper is great, if we really want to save trees, we have to seriously discourage the cutting of trees by opting out from using or accepting paper correspondence.

Recycling is good, however only a few environmentally conscious people like you make effort to do so. More than 90 % of people don't like junk mail, and they get rid of it by simply  putting them in the garbage. As a result, the junk mail does not get recycled.

When businesses are not aware that you do not want to receive mail from them, they will continue to send it, and that means even MORE junk mail.

What you can do to help eliminate paper activities:

Unsubscribe from receiving paper activities and educate family, friends and colleagues to do so for free with @imailapp and help save the 100billion #trees cut every year to make non-essential products like paper especially. ....

ABOUT
As unemployment severely rises, oil prices plummet, and some governments insist on bailing out a dying fossil fuel industry— the COVID-19 pandemic has laid bare the severe cracks in our global economic system. Rooted in neo-liberal capitalism, the current economic system is set to continue to rapaciously extract resources from the Earth and drive the dual crises of climate chaos and pandemics, while exploiting the labor of people worldwide to line the pockets of wealthy CEOs, fossil fuel companies and other large corporations. As we see disaster capitalism play out in real time, we must disrupt the system and call for a regenerative, rights-based economy that prioritizes communities and nature.

An integral part of the fight for climate justice is rejecting false market-driven ""solutions."" This includes the effort to expose and dismantle the roots of the extractivist economy that is inextricably intertwined with the patriarchal system that has been exploiting women and the environment for centuries. Women are on the frontlines of the climate crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic, making up 70% of healthcare workers worldwide and the majority of unpaid care workers who bear the brunt of a broken economic system.

We are calling for a transition from a colonial paradigm of “exploit and extract” to a regenerative, globally-conscious one of “respect and restore.” What is needed now is an investment in alternative economic models predicated on community-led solutions, Indigenous knowledge, and ancient concepts of reciprocity with the Earth and all living beings. Already there are Indigenous economies to learn from and an emergence of socially just, place-based economic models that are structuring a path forward.

This webinar is part of WECAN’s Advocacy and Solutions Series: A Just and Healthy World is Possible, an ongoing webinar program lifting up women's leadership as we continue to collectively build a powerful movement founded on principles of justice, love, and a fierce dedication to our planet and each other.

"(Please note: I made my lyrics 100% clean rather than explicit so that anyone can hear my message. The point of this song is not to sway anyone’s opinion or to start a debate or a fight. Rather - my purpose is to explain why I, and millions of Americans just like myself feel the way we do about President Trump. Please respect my *opinions* - DON’T try to reason with me, just UNDERSTAND.)

My statement is below. If you decide that my music is no longer for you - then so it must be.

For the longest time, I have always kept my political beliefs mostly to myself. I have also never considered myself to be a Democrat or a Republican. Today my silence ends here. I will not allow anyone to tell me that I should wear a muzzle or keep politics out of my artistry, especially in times like these. This election is critical to what the future of this country will look like. We have to ask ourselves, is this truly who we want to be? Everything is on the ballot during this critical election. The mishandling of a pandemic, 200k+ lives lost, millions of jobs lost, health care at risk, human rights, racial injustices, an on-going climate crisis, & so much more. We currently have a president heading down a path of authoritarianism, who actively tries to divide the American people. A president who fuels the flames of white supremacy. A president who refers to our fallen soldiers as “suckers” & “losers”. Democracy as we know it is on the line & we cannot afford to allow this anymore. That’s why I am proudly & openly supporting Joe Biden & Kamala Harris. I am voting for decency, for hope, and for unity. If your family/friends are Trump supporters and you are scared of their judgment (I however, am not.) - just remember: you can say that you are voting for Trump while silently voting for Biden, and nobody will know. Even if Trump wins this election, he will lose in the end - LOVE will always win over HATE in the end. We are not RED & BLUE states, we are the UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.

"Please RSVP to attend the pre-rulemaking workshop in Montebello on April 1 from 6:30-8:30 PM. We need you to urge decision-makers to roll out setback limits to protect California residents impacted by oil drilling.

In December, Governor Gavin Newsom instructed the state entity that regulates oil and gas, California Geologic Energy Management Division (CalGEM), to establish rules to protect public health and the environment from the impacts of oil and gas extraction.

CalGEM will host a series of pre-rulemaking workshops to invite public comment on the best ways to protect human health through new rules. Concerns shared at these meetings will inform the formal rulemaking, and this is an important time for the public to speak out.

Dirty oil and gas drilling poses serious health risks. Studies link proximity to oil and gas wells to a host of health impacts, including cancer, premature mortality, asthma, and other respiratory ailments. These impacts are not distributed equally, with communities of color and low-income communities being most affected. Over 5.4 million Californians live within a mile of at least one dirty oil and gas well. We must encourage CalGEM to establish the most protective rules, including a rule that creates a 2,500-foot health-and-safety buffer zone between fossil-fuel infrastructure and homes, schools, and other sensitive sites.

Big Oil has been aggressively fighting against changes to oil drilling practices. If we don't speak up, they will make sure they are out in force to fight new rules.

RSVP TODAY. Urge CalGEM to develop the best rules to protect public health from the impacts of oil drilling, including a setback.

We need to have folks at this meeting to make sure our voice is louder than the oil industry’s. Each person attending will get 2 minutes to speak, if they choose to.

Thank you in advance for showing up for this meeting and speaking up."

"Profits over people. 

What does that mean, in practice? On a societal level it means prioritizing the drive for profit over the wider needs of the public. But what does it mean on a personal level?

On a personal level it means that you have determined that what matters most to you is getting that new house with the extra thousand square feet, upgrading the cars you and your wife drive, and being able to send your children to private school over the negative consequences of what it took to attain those things. In some cases the negative consequences of certain occupations are negligible, in other cases they are more transparent and obvious. 

For example, perhaps you're a  lobbyist for the chemical industry, and you successfully convince a parish in Louisiana to allow a new chemical plant to be built there. You did a good job. And in your community, you're a successful and respected man. 

After all, you're a member of the exclusive country club, and you drive an imported luxury car. Not to mention those Louis Vuitton bags your wife has! You live in a gorgeous house in the suburbs of Baton Rouge. Where there isn't a non-white person to be found! You go to church on Sundays. You help coach your son's baseball team and the other dad's think you're a cool guy. Sometimes you'll take one of them to a LSU football game, where you have a luxury box. The ladies think you're handsome, but your wife tries her best to keep your playful flirtations within acceptable limits. 

Of course, the residents of that town on the river where the plant is being built will never be the same. Cases of cancer and asthma and other diseases will begin to increase. Their access to healthcare is minimal on account of their socioeconomic status and the limitations of living in a small town. Surely, some will die as a result of the pollution from the new plant in this region known as ""cancer-alley."" 

But these plants must be built. They've got to go somewhere. That's a small price to pay for all the benefits that this progress and modernity has brought us. Of course, you wouldn't want them near your home. But why would they be near your home? You're successful. You're a winner. You're a good man, you think to yourself as you dig into the mound of fried seafood the server  just plopped down on the table. Yes, life is good.

""If you’re some poor black person living in a river parish in Louisiana where chemical plants pump your air full of cancer-causing carcinogens, then so what? So what if your child lies in bed at night, with asthma, chest heaving as his small, developing body struggles for air? Remind me why I should care? That chemical plant has brought x number of jobs that result in x number of tax dollars for that town. Lives treated as economic units by men with MBAs trained in the extremist ideology of Milton Friedman, and James Buchanan. Men able to justify anything without the slightest sense of empathy. Because it’s not them making these decisions, they’re quick to point out. It’s the “market”. This market whose laws, in their mind, are as immutable as those of gravity.""

"Protect our young players from traffic pollution at Boggs Football and Soccer Fields.

Please join us in creating a double green native plant and tree wall to help protect our young players from traffic pollution at Boggs Football and Soccer Fields.
 
The residents of Hollywood plan to plant a double row of native Florida trees and bushes around Boggs Field in order to help protect our children’s lungs from the nanoparticle pollution emanating from traffic on Sheridan St - one of the busier streets in Broward County. A street that will only get busier as Dania North Point continues to fill in, and Oakwood develops into a residential area. The installation of 500 to 700 trees will BEGIN with 50 to 60 plantings on the week of Earth Day, April 22, 2020. Proceeds from this fundraiser will be used for purchase of trees and bushes, and weedwacker protection. All labor will be provided by volunteers.
Bushes and Trees are a documented way to reduce traffic pollution from travelling, especially if used in combination. You may have seen this already in some parts of the Turnpike in NW Broward, although done with only two species. In order to ensure the wall does not succumb to a disease, best practices suggest a variety of species. We envision this project this to exclusively include Florida native bushes and trees: Jamaican caper, Marlberry,  Coccoplum, Firebush, Florida Tetrazygia, Silver Buttonwood, Varnish leaf,  White Indigoberry, White Stopper, Pigeon plum, Dahoon Holly, Lancewood, Pearlberry, Green Buttonwood, Paradise Tree, Gumbo Limbo, Live Oak and Mastic.
We estimate we will need 700 plants in total for this project, to protect both the soccer field on the west side and the football field on the east side. This would cover the north side to Sheridan, and the east and west facing perimeter. It would also provide several shade trees in the south perimeter should the parents and the clubs want them.

"PSE crews have painted trees on 148th Ave between Main Street and SE 16th St.  The trees will exhale the last of their clean air in the coming days and weeks.  Residents of Bellevue will be shocked at the scale of destruction to build a redundant power line that will not alleviate 99% of power outages in the Lake Hills area.

Bellevue Mayor Lynne Robinson defends the project: ""Any development project in a growing city such as Bellevue requires cutting down trees.""

If you are concerned about the implications of this policy for our ""City in a Park,"" please come to Bellevue City Hall this Monday night at 8 pm.  Several speakers will ask the city council to comment on our proposal to ask PSE to voluntarily bury the power line.  We have suggested a public/private partnership with some of Bellevue's leading employers to cover the increased cost.  Although the cost has been significantly higher in the past, modern horizontal drilling technology (developed to serve low-cost fracking of natural gas) can be employed for this project.

"Q: What is the first part of the body to show signs of aging?
A: It’s hard to believe… but, it’s the NECK!
Why is this?

Well, the neck, along with the face, is one of the body parts most exposed to harsh weather, chemicals, pollution, and other environmental toxins - not to mention, our skin on the neck is thin and incredibly delicate.

So why does the neck seemingly age more quickly than the face?

Because the skin on the neck and decolletage is often neglected and even when treated - using the same creams for the face just won't cut it, as the neck features a different type of skin than the face does.

So how can one begin to treat the neck area even once sagging and loose skin has already begun to set in?

"Raja Ampat’s reefs have supported human life from the moment the first people arrived in the region, thousands of years ago.  Today, these reefs continue to support life and livelihoods for local communities, whose future relies heavily upon a continued state of reef health.

Yet whilst many of Raja Ampat's reefs are healthy and thriving, there are also those that have been damaged from human activity, past and present. Dynamite fishing, anchor damage, boat strike, kicking and trampling, along with COTS, disease, pollution and climate change - all threaten these reefs.

The SEA People / Orang Laut works with local communities on reef restoration projects that restore degraded areas. We view Yaf Keru as so much more than simply an exercise in “transplanting coral”, but as a means to improve several fundamental aspects of local livelihoods, which in turn can contribute to improved sustainability, management and conservation of the worlds most biodiverse coral reefs. 

👉To find our more about our reef restoration work, please visit https://theseapeople.org/yaf-keru-reef-restoration/

"🍃Recycle For A Life Cycle🍃
.
I've been seeing many articles about climate change and such and it really puts a dent in my mood. I really wish America was progressive in being more kind to the earth. When I went to Germany, they were really big on recycling and their green fields were the most beautiful atmosphere I've ever seen in nature. I understand even though I as an individual isn't enough to fully change the climate change situation; I want to express on my platform the importance of recycling, minimizing your carbon footprint, using reusable bags, and other methods to make things easier for the earth. Hope you enjoy this piece and message. ♻️

"Rivers.Global works for A CLEANER OCEAN.
Just before Norway shut down, I was reminded of the importance of this as I took a stroll at the Sola Beach near Stavanger. Cold water of course in March, but still, the water was ever so clean! What a contrast to the photo taken by Lekima Hung of a beach in Tuy Phong, Vietnam. Lekima drove his motorbike from north to south in Vietnam to make a photo documentary of plastic pollution in the country. This is one of the photos, find more at www.rivers.global
There are beautiful beaches in Vietnam, and temperatures much nicer than in Norway (!), but sadly enough many of them have lots of astray plastic.

"Sancre Productions is proud to present ""I am Cheo,"" a Hispanic Access Foundation Film about Latinos, Environmental Justice and Wildfires.

Inspired by the poem “I Am Joaquin” by Chicano poet Corky Gonzales, this unique film tells the story of a young boy named Cheo who, from the sights and smells of his abuela’s kitchen, takes a sweeping cinematic journey across the lands that are both his history and his future - he sees the gorges of the Grand Canyon, the antiquity of New Mexican acequias, the majesty of the Rockies, and the urban warmth of Downtown Los Angeles. 

On this journey, Cheo realizes that he is formed by these places - but they need his help, as they are devastated by wildfires, pollution, climate change and disrepair. Cheo then decides to raise his voice and take action to protect the environment for his familia and generations to come, as it is him and he is it."

Dear Councilmembers,

We all make mistakes.  To make amends, we admit our mistakes, apologize, and find productive ways to move forward.

The Bellevue community asks our City Council to admit that its 2015 vote to approve the destruction of 300 trees and allow PSE to build a redundant power line was a mistake.  We ask the Council to state that the very modest gains in electrical reliability offered by this project could have been achieved using alternative solutions without impacting the park-like feeling of 148th Avenue and NE 8th St.

With this apology, the negative impacts of the new power line will be on PSE’s shoulders, not yours.

If you do not feel you can make such a statement, please explain to your constituents what your view of this project is.  Is it okay to destroy the City’s natural resources and the heritage of future generations?  Especially when clean air and climate change are concerns for most of Bellevue’s residents?

We need to hear from you.

Respectfully,

[YOUR NAME]"

As a vegetarian for 18 years often times I am unable to find vegetarian restaurants while traveling abroad. However, in recent years more vegan/ veggie cafes are on the rise and popping up all over the world since I started my solo travels back in 2010. Iceland was actually the hardest country for me to find veggie foods. 
•
People are becoming more health conscious and realizing how a plant- based or veggie diet will be key to the sustainability of our food planet. I read that compared to diets that include meat, a study found that vegetarian/ vegan diets produced 49% fewer greenhouse gas emissions. Also, a vegetarian diet uses less water and reduces climate change.

"Since the issue of oil and gas is a pertinent one in our county and around the United States , it is crucial to understand the negative health impact of this pollution on the health of all, especially Latino communities who are at risk. 

This is what we know: 

•  More than 1.81 million Latinos live within
a half mile of existing oil and gas facilities and the number is growing every year.

• Latinos are exposed to disproportionately high levels of air pollution.

• Rates of asthma are relatively high in Latino communities.

• Many Latinos are particularly burdened with health impacts from this air pollution due to high levels of poverty and relatively low rates of health insurance coverage.

• The air in many Latino communities violates air quality standards for ozone smog.
– Due to ozone increases resulting from oil
and gas emissions, Latino communities are burdened by 153,000 asthma attacks and 112,000 lost school days each year.

• Many Latino communities face an elevated risk of cancer due to air toxics emissions from oil and gas development.

– Nearly 1.78 million Latinos live in counties
that face a cancer risk above EPA’s level of concern from toxics emitted by oil and gas facilities.
More needs to be done to address the air pollution

"Since today is the last day of Discovery Shark Week! We would be remiss if we did not include the fabulous stingray!

Here are five fabulous facts about stingrays from Nat Geo Kids:
1) Rays and skates are flattened fish closely related to sharks.
2) Although they look near identical, rays and skates are actually different.
3) Stingrays and skates feed on crustaceans, small fish, snails, clams, shrimp and other small creatures.
4) Sadly, numbers of sting ray are in decline. Overfishing, habitat loss and climate change are the major threats to rays.
5) Stingrays' natural predators are sharks, seals, sea lions and other large fish.

We need to adopt small changes to have a big environmental impact. Access to drinking water in public places & refill fountains is a good start. ⠀

"Small changes can make a big difference 🌿
✨Eat local - shop at your local super markets for in-season fruits and veggies! If you like in a cold area like I do, try to cut back in exotic fruits and pre-packaged veggies. Try shopping in season, and cutting back when not in season. ✨Vintage shopping - vintage is in! Shop in your local thrift stores for high in clothes at a low cost! You’re helping your local shop and cutting back in demand for low-quality and high-waste fashion. ✨ Bike or carpool - no shame in hoping a ride with a friend! Do you go t the same school as a friend of sibling? Take one car. This cute back on the emissions used and helps your wallet! ✨Bring your own cups - addicted to coffee? Me too. Try bruins coffee at home and taking it with you, or recycling your cups after you use them! Places like Starbucks and Dunkins have already made the move to cut out styrofoam cups and hey, bring your own straw! ♻️Reduce ♻️ Reuse ♻️ Recycle

Since the majority of people are skimmers and won’t actually click the article link, here’s a preview of a few things that I share: •
•
* Environmental Protection Agency (EPA): The air inside our home is up to five times more polluted than the air outside which makes us more prone to cough, asthma and viral respiratory illnesses, nausea and a suppressed immune system. •
•
*A company out of Denmark has created a new technology using UV (like we get from sunshine) that successfully kills the coronavirus. •
•
*Center for Climate, Health, and the Global Environment: Breathing air inside our homes makes us more prone to getting a lung infection. COVID-19 primarily affects the lungs. •
•
*I also share scientific evidence that the SARS coronavirus (yes, SARS was a coronavirus) outbreak in 2003 showed higher infection rates from regions with higher air pollution creating an 84% more likelihood of dying than those in less polluted areas. •

"Some very persuasive points from the green and just perspective....

""Is meat more essential than the lives of the working poor who labor to produce it? It seems so. An astonishing six out of 10 counties that the White House itself identified as coronavirus hot spots are home to the very slaughterhouses the president ordered open.""

""If cows were a country, they would be the third-largest greenhouse gas emitter in the world.""

""...eating a plant-based diet is 'the most important contribution every individual can make to reversing global warming.'”

""Don’t we need animal protein? No. We can live longer, healthier lives without it. Most American adults eat roughly twice the recommended intake of protein — including vegetarians, who consume 70 percent more than they need. People who eat diets high in animal protein are more likely to die of heart disease, diabetes and kidney failure.""

""Isn’t a movement away from meat elitist? No. A 2015 study found that a vegetarian diet is $750 a year cheaper than a meat-based diet. People of color disproportionately self-identify as vegetarian and disproportionately are victims of factory farming’s brutality. The slaughterhouse employees currently being put at risk to satisfy our taste for meat are overwhelmingly brown and black. Suggesting that a cheaper, healthier, less exploitative way of farming is elitist is in fact a piece of industry propaganda.""

The largest bay in the world which flows into the northeastern Indian Ocean brought kings, conquerors and adventurers alike to Bangladesh. Bodies of water have an enormous impact on the people who live near them and this year, we’re joining @unworldoceansday to celebrate @bangladeshsurfgirlsandboys who beat the odds everyday to surf Cox’s Bazar beach in the heart of Bangladesh’s Bay of Bengal.  
 
In the wee hours of the morning, the ‘surf kids’ as they’re affectionately known, can be seen riding Cox’s Bazar’s unpredictable waves. Some of them attend school in the day and return to the beach at night to sell tea, snacks and trinkets to tourists to support their families. 
 
Climate change is causing erratic weather patterns and the coastal communities face the threat of losing their homes. Sea-levels are predicted to rise up to a metre over the next century, and if true, this would inundate the homes of millions of Bangladeshis, including these passionate, fledgling surfers.

"Sorry. Buying a bunch of 'green' alternatives to things you already own is not reducing use of resources. The most eco-friendly products you can use, are the ones you ALREADY HAVE. ♻️
.
Buying all hemp clothes so you can throw your entire closet into a landfill doesn't make environmental sense. 👎
.
Buying an 'eco-friendly' reusable bag, when you already had perfectly good options, is still overconsumption. .
As our friend @trissykay says, you don't need to BUY a new reusable set of utensils when you can literally pick a fork, spoon, and knife from your drawer and take them on-the-go! .
If you throw out your plastic toothbrush or travel mug 'before its time', just so you can start using one made from sustainable materials, you're missing the point. 😬
.
We need to BUY LESS STUFF. .
Giving someone a metal straw who never used/needed a straw in the first place is not helping the planet.
.
Materials, manufacturing, labor, shipping...all still consume resources and contribute to pollution - even for 'green' products. .
Not suggesting it's bad to support companies creating BETTER alternatives, or that we should feel guilty for buying products we need. But we're under a spell of overconsumption and consumerism, and ""ecofriendly "" can be a marketing word just like any other, to convince you to get something you don't need. .
As @larrySantoyo says, 'make your handprint bigger than your footprint'. Buying a composting bin for example (even if it's plastic) is a net positive. Just be mindful when you can. BUYING LESS overall will usually be the more conscious option.

"Spreading the Wealth of Nature

Be a Helping Hand is proud to announce a new community tree planting initiative with Root Nashville, with initial start-up support from the Metro Public Health Department. Together, we will prioritize our most valuable climate solution - TREES! This partnership focuses planting efforts at our affordable housing sites, starting with North Nashville and expanding into other neighborhoods, in order to improve the health of our communities and provide a natural climate solution.

Tree planting will kick off in North Nashville on Saturday, February 15. This first planting of the initiative is just the beginning of the partnership between Be a Helping Hand and Root Nashville. Tree planting will continue throughout upcoming planting seasons and in various neighborhoods across the county where we have affordable housing. Be a Helping Hand and Root Nashville are also exploring other methods of greening for public health and the health of our planet.

Studies have shown that green space and access to nature are vital to health and well-being. Our partnership developed in response to the increasing disparities in housing along economic lines, which have resulted in documented “hot spots” of temperatures up to 5-17 degrees higher than surrounding rural, wooded areas, due to lack of green space. This heat disparity has a dramatic effect on health and quality of life. In addition, neighborhoods with a lack of trees and tree shade are typically populated by African American and immigrant communities (Racist Housing Practices From The 1930s Linked To Hotter Neighborhoods Today, NPR).

The health of our environment and our quality of life are intertwined. Trees provide so many essential benefits to our livelihood and are a natural climate solution.

Environmental benefits: Trees remove carbon dioxide out of the air, produce oxygen, reduce air pollution, cool the climate, and reduce erosion and flooding. Trees also help to improve water quality and provide food and habitat for numerous species of wildlife.

Economic benefits: Trees reduce energy bills due to their cooling and wind protection effects, create a more attractive environment which improves property values. With a more inviting atmosphere, trees also increase community pride and customer base.

Social benefits: Trees reduce crime and violence, provide a sense of security, ease mental fatigue, and create feelings of relaxation and well-being. They also provide noise reduction, help alleviate ADD and asthma, and encourage physical activity. Trees increase overall quality of life by encouraging people out of their homes and into natural open space, where they are more likely to interact with others and build stronger social relationships. 

In addition, as part of the Metro Public Health Department grant, trees will also be planted at the Hull Jackson Montessori School, in the same North Nashville neighborhood as the Be a Helping Hand properties. This additional planting site will compound the benefits of trees for many of our residents’ children, and for the neighborhood as a whole.

Be a Helping Hand is a nonprofit affordable housing organization focused on underserved communities in North Nashville and the surrounding metropolitan areas. Your support of Be a Helping Hand will help us continue to provide affordable housing to our Nashville neighbors in need and ensures that greening efforts like this tree planting initiative can continue and expand. Click here to support our mission and our continued efforts to improve community livability.

This initiative works in accord with the Livable Nashville Committee and the Root Nashville goal to plant 500,000 trees in Davidson County by 2050. The Root Nashville campaign is a public-private partnership led by the Cumberland River Compact and Metro Nashville. Their goal is to restore and grow our city’s precious tree canopy, which is in decline due to Nashville’s unprecedented growth. We urge other affordable housing nonprofits and developers to take action and to join us in being part of the climate solution by committing to planting trees on new and existing properties. Visit https://rootnashville.org to learn more.

Thank you Root Nashville and the Metro Public Health Department for making our idea of this program come to fruition! We look forward to continuing this partnership and growing our city in a green way.

Composting Reduces Waste 🍌

Composting is nature's way of recycling. Composting is a sustainable way to reuse scraps as you do your part to reduce waste in landfills. Composting helps crops and plants grow. Did you know that food waste and yard waste, make up 25 to 50% of what people throw away? While you may not be able to compost all of the organic waste you generate, composting can significantly cut down on your overall trash. When we throw away food waste, it decomposes in a landfill and releases methane gas, a potent greenhouse gas. Do your research, take it slow and start composting what you can.

"Thanks for the support so far for our World Elephant Day annual fundraiser.🐘🐘

The planet needs elephants now more than ever, as they are climate change heroes:
* as megabrowsers, they help preserve grasslands, which reduce solar radiation, keeping the planet cooler
* as a keystone species, they help maintain wildlife ecosystems
* their dung is powerfully fertile, which helps soil regeneration (critical for carbon sequestration)
* certain hardwood trees — which are also excellent carbon storers — count on elephants to propagate, through seed dispersal

World Elephant Day needs just a small amount to operate annually for the important work we do — such as getting billions of social media impressions every August 12th, which puts the plight of elephants in the global spotlight.

(The donations go to World Elephant Society, the 501(c)3 that oversees World Elephant Day.)

Donate today — any amount will help!"

"The 2nd in what has become an ongoing series of Indigenous Women on both sides of the border dismantling it: American Women (dismantling the border)II 2017—is part of an ongoing thread of works depicting the U.S. Mexico wall being dismantled by American Indigenous women (from the U.S. on one side; and from Mexico and Central America on the other). Most borders which define Nation States—topics of such heated debate—were only recently built, created by Colonial conquest, and are false constructs—hastily drawn lines etching across and carving up lands inhabited for millennia by Indigenous peoples. Thus, it is the right of the Indigenous to dismantle the oppressive walls and artificial distinctions of the world: walls that slice through the heart of communities and ecosystems-- the only function of which is fear-based exclusion. In my rendition, as in the era in which we find ourselves-- an era that has seen a resurgence of Native Resistance movements, I have portrayed feminine solidarity and dignity in action.
After half a millennia of persecution, the Pueblos and other Indigenous communities continue to struggle for their inherent rights to ancestral sacred lands and ritual.  Time and again, they have defied governments through peaceful means and won.  Kivas are no longer raided, children no longer dragged off to boarding schools. However, the earth below their feet is continually under assault due to resource extraction—fracking, mining, pipelines; as is the sky above their heads by drones, missiles, toxic fumes.  Nonetheless, the connection to ancient ways in New Mexico’s Pueblos and beyond is strong; once dismissed, these ways are now being increasingly embraced by communities all over the world—as perhaps the only way for a viable future…

"The air pollution conversation used to revolve almost entirely around pollutants emitted from gas-burning vehicles. But, recent studies in Los Angeles have shown that Volatile Chemical Products (VCPs) contribute as much to the abundance of urban Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) as the emissions of motor vehicles.
.
🤔 What are they? 🤔
VCPs are products that easily become vapors or gases and are predominantly emitted in the indoor environment, where they release VOCs. They can be transported to the outdoors via building exhaust where they add to the pollution of the ozone layer. VOCs are up to 10x higher indoors. They are also released from several everyday consumer products containing volatile chemicals like cigarettes, paints/thinners, air fresheners, personal care products (shampoo, soap, etc.), solvents (in adhesives, cleaners, lacquers, etc.), copy machines, printers, building materials, furnishings, and pesticides.
.
✋ Control and eliminate sources of VOCs ✋
The top two categories of indoor air pollution are personal care products and adhesives. Here’s how to keep VOCs out of your home:
- Look for fragrance-free products
- Choose non-toxic cleaning products that are water based and without solvents
- Reduce overall use of personal care products
- Don’t stock up on products you only use occasionally (like paint, fuel, and chemicals) and, if you do, be sure to store them far from your living area
- Always follow manufacturer instructions when it comes to storing products with chemicals
- Never mix household cleaners with other chemicals unless specified
- Keep all products out of reach of pets and children
- Use an air purifier or whole-home ventilation to ensure a healthy indoor environment for your family
.
Our air purifiers reduce airborne pollutants, allergens, microbes, odors, and more. They can be a key piece in reducing the VOCs in your home!

"The best advice I ever got was after I was sexually attacked in my own home by a masseuse in Bali.

I was obviously freaking out, confused, horrified. The worst part... I felt guilty. 😥😱🤮🤦🏽‍♀️

This guilt was a very familiar feeling. It was my bestie for as long as I could remember.

I was sexually abused as a child. I felt guilt. 😟

I wasn't recognised by my gymnastics coaches for being the best. I felt guilt. 😟

I didn't get an A. I felt guilt. 😟

My siblings became addicts. I felt guilt. 😟

It's so mind blowing to know that for 80% of my life until I was 36 years old I felt guilty, not happy. 😱🤯

No wonder I married the most abusive boyfriend I ever had. 🥺

After I was sexually attacked in my own home I felt sorry for myself.

I felt powerless. 

My mind started going back to all the times since age 5 I had been attacked. 🤮☠️😵

I went down the rabbit hole really fast.

The best advice I ever got was this...

""Do not feel sorry for yourself. You have done too much work to drop back down now. You are an Amazon Warrior Woman."" ✨🌍👑

I felt that. 

If you're reading this it's because there are things in your life that are not working.

I'll tell ya, no one came to my house to sort out all my dog crap sabotaging beliefs for me. ❌

No prince charming came to rescue me just as I was about to say ""I Do"" 👰🏽 to the most deadly marriage. ❌

💪🏾 No one put in the repetitions and training for me to change my ""I'm not enough"" beliefs to my present beliefs which are...
 
""I AM A FREAKING BAD ASS WONDER WOMAN AND I AM WORHTY OF HAVING IT ALL. ""💃🔥🥰👑

Yes, I did the work. But I didn't do it alone. Having someone believe in me was everything. 😭🙏🏾🥰

For the first time I felt safe enough to let my guilt go. 🙏🏾👊🏾🚀

Having a strong woman who had already healed herself from abuse and trauma tell me I could do better, and that she believed in me... was a game changer. 👊🏾🌍💃

When we don't know what we don't know, we do the wrong thing. 

When my thinking was the same I kept recycling my experiences over and over. Nothing changed. 🤮😵

I healed because I was ready to change, which is always the first step. No one can do this for us.

The second step was facing the truth. No more blaming external circumstances for my unhappiness. 💪🏾

I was responsible for where I was and what I had. 👏🏾🏆

It wasn't that I deserved what had happened to me. It was that I believed I deserved what happened to me. 

Mind blown.

A strong woman takes responsibility for her happiness and acknowledges that in order for things to change, she must change. 👑

We weren't put here to do this alone. 👯 

There is an unseen energy force when healed women help other women heal. 🌍

It's the most radical form of energy I have ever felt. 🪐🌈☄️💫🌍🌙

If you know you can do better, and you're finally ready to have a strong, loving woman believe in you, then you have to come to my free online workshop. 💃

Literally picture the Amazonians on the Wonder Woman island, ready to conquer the world together. 👑🏝️💥

This will be the most powerful work you do on yourself this year. I'm sharing how to tap into Unconditional Love and Divine Feminine Energy.

https://purpose.laninalu.com/workshop-purpose

In this LIVE workshop with me, I will be sharing my 5- Steps You Need To Live Up To Your Full Potential And Step In To Your Purpose..

You will learn...

​✅How to feel in control of your happiness.
✅​How you can breakthrough the negative, exhausted life you have.
✅How to finally release your guilt and believe you are enough
​✅EXACTLY HOW TO REACH YOUR FULL POTENTIAL

"The BIG questions:

Will the virus continue on a moderate trajectory as we begin to open the economy?

Will a highly leveraged economy be able to survive in a world of reduced consumption and increased consumer savings rate?

Will the real estate market be able to keep prices suspended high above the historical average, thus sustaining the construction industry?

Will the record unemployment rate make a quick come back or will this be a long, slow, drawn out process?

Will the stock market return to record high valuations (price to earnings ratio) or will it revert back to the historic mean?

When will viable treatments or vaccines be ready?

How much new money will the fed print to fight a crashing economy?  How much deficit spending will the government announce, and where will this money go?

Which countries will be the first to get a handle on this virus, and avoid a second outbreak?

What will the China US trade relationship look like 1 year from now?

Which president will win the election given the current back drop?

Will the US shale industry make a come back?  When will oil prices return to a stable level?

What will the retail industry look like 1 year from now?  Will online retailers conquer the market?  Will mom and pop shops need to close down as large retailers weather the storm?"
"“The caravans of refugees coming to the USA's southern border are part of an uninterrupted history of forced migrations and trails of tears. Those who deny these ‘huddled masses’ on the US-Mexico border do so, in part, to deny the obvious—man-made climate crisis may soon make refugees of us all. No wall will protect us from the wrath of a dying planet.”—Charlene Teters (Spokane)

The Institute of American Indian Arts (IAIA) Academic Dean and noted artist, educator, and activist, Charlene Teters presented a new exhibition, “Charlene Teters: Way of Sorrows,” at the IAIA Museum of Contemporary Native Arts (MoCNA) earlier this month. The following images, taken at the artist reception on February 13, 2020, show the installation addressing current issues such as forced migrations and the US-Mexico border crisis, as well as a performance piece of the “Ladies of Survival”—four women, including Teters, robed in emergency blankets like those given to refugees. Not willing to “sugar-coat the heaviness of the issues,” Teters has created a stark and striking environment for viewers. As Teters remarked, “A platform for conversation is all I could hope for.” “Way of Sorrows” will remain in the North Gallery at MoCNA—located in downtown Santa Fe, New Mexico—until May 17, 2020.

"The Impact of Wearing a Cloth Face Mask!
Wearing a cloth mask can have a HUGE impact on your community. Check out these reasons that our masks make a difference.
1. Cloth masks are proven to be effective. COVID-19 infection rates have decreased after states put out orders mandating face masks. Check out this article from the University of California San Francisco for more information.
 https://rb.gy/v1pxx0
2. Supporting Local Businesses. Many local seamstresses and sewers, including myself, have started mask making businesses. Buying from someone in or around your community is a great way to reinvest in the local economy and support those affected by the current financial crisis.
3. Donations. Ashley's Homemade Masks donates a portion of each sale to The Ray Graham Association and the HCS Food Bank. So far, our efforts have raised almost $12,000 that goes directly to support the local community! Your purchase directly impacts the lives of others affected by hardships. Aside from that, your purchase enables us to purchase materials to make masks to donate. Thanks to our wonderful customers, we have been able to donate almost 2,000 masks, with plans to donate more. Providing other members of the community with a mask means you are even more protected.
4. The Environment!!! Single use face masks, while important in a medical setting, can have a significant impact on the environment. Even back in March, OceansAsia found heaps of masks across Asian shorelines. The material used to make these masks, while effective at keeping bacteria out, takes a long time to break down, meaning those masks end up in a landfill or the ocean, harming many animals and causing more and more pollution. https://earth.org/covid-19-unmasking-the-environmental-impact/
There you have it! Cloth masks support you, the economy, other community members, and the environment. Consider purchasing one today to reap these benefits or sharing this post to help spread the word about our efforts to slow COVID-19"

"The IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) is Corrupt!

I performed expert review of IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) SR 1.5 Chapter Two “Mitigation” https://cctruth.org/expert_review_SR1.5_mitigation.pdf . These are the key findings: Their equilibrium statements had no references to any published manuscripts. One of the chapter scientists replied and said they are not equilibrium states and they are from simulations. I showed their simulations to a friend who has 27 years’ experience and he started uncontrollable laughter. Further down in their document was the only probability they did is 50-66% for their solution by lowering emissions will work. I sent this to around 1000 scientists, the worldwide media, the UN and IPCC scientists. The media ignored it. However, IPCC working Group 1 and 3 saw my expert review ability and invited me to review their reports for AR6 next year. https://cctruth.org/comments_ar6wg3_fod.xlsx is already accepted for WG 3. https://cctruth.org/comments_ar6wg1_sod.xlsx will be uploaded by 4/26/2020.  40 other Ph. D.s are going to put similar comments as these. The reports the IPCC makes reference manuscripts published in Nature Climate Change. Adam Yeeley PH D. is the chief editor. His Ph. D. is in Political Science. He is just a gatekeeper for the corrupt IPCC. Planting Native trees is the only way to lower Atmospheric carbon dioxide to 330 ppm by 2031.

We have some very supportive and concerned state legislators and state agencies; however, we can not control any action or inaction at the state and federal level, but we can control the action at our level.

"The national uprising ignited by the murder of George Floyd has cast a spotlight on the country’s embedded, institutional racism, including the fraught relationship between environmentalism and communities of color. Air pollution, severe weather and the economic upheaval brought on by climate change impacts black and minority communities first and worst, yet their voices are often left out of policy responses and market solutions. How can we amplify and advocate for leaders of color in the fight against climate change? What can allies do to create a green movement that is inclusive and actively anti-racist?

Join us to talk about climate and racism w/ Mustafa Santiago Ali from National Wildlife Federation, Robert Bullard from Texas Southern University & Glynda Carr from Higher Heights for America."

"""The overwhelming majority of climate deniers are white men. That's because they've been marketed the idea that addressing climate change is somehow a plot to remake the social order with them on the bottom instead of the top, and the mechanism for doing so will be a strong central government that has the power to reshape industries, the power to tax and regulate. That is, of course, what's necessary for swift action on climate change. But there's no reason why should be seen as an inherent bad to white men.""

"THE PERFECT STORM#1 PROJECT -STILL MAKES MONEY @ $10 OIL..

In response to the severe crisis that has hit the oil industry in the US and the rest of the world, we have put together our current and largest oil project to date with 58 small/Shallow oil wells ( 10 % working interest up for sale), they are all producing from a depth of between 400 to 1700 feet, at this time we have just about 25 wells on production, and a current daily production of approx.  40 barrels of crude oil, this will improve, when all are equipped with submersible pumps and treated with nitrogen and bacteria, which we have carried out on several well so far, this with great success actually up to 6 x more in production volume, several wells are between 4-8 barrels daily after treatment.

So if you are looking for a place to invest your hard earned money and still support the US domestic oil business, then this project could be for you, payout happens every month and if the oil price gets too far down, then we just leave the oil in our storage tanks which we can get more of, not much money would be necessary to do that.

"""The phrase “Okay, Boomer,” gained prominence last year when a Millennial member of the New Zealand parliament used it to silence a heckling older statesman. Chloe Swarbrick was in the midst of delivering a passionate speech about how climate change is threatening her generation, when a “Boomer” became agitated. The term was a flippant retort, but also a dismissal of all those born between 1946 and 1964, deeming them out-of-touch and close-minded. Indeed, it is “sticks and stones” payback for many Gen Y’ers who believe that the term “Millennial” has been similarly used to dub all young people as entitled and mollycoddled.""

"The quick answer is no, you still have time. Birds establish habits easily, and this is especially true when it comes to feeding. Once a feeding habit develops, it can take between 3 and 12 weeks to retrain birds. 

Designing your facility with bird control in mind is the easiest way to maintain a bird-free facility. Just ask the City of Reno transit station - they learned this valuable lesson. Since their designs proactively addressed this problem using BirdBuffer, birds never appeared in the new location. 

If you're still worried it's too late to see these benefits... keep reading.

Transit stations are a main hub for buses, commuters … and birds. They can build sheltered nests in the rafters, eat scraps that are easily available, and stay safe from predators intimidated by noise and traffic. For a bird, transit stations are practically a destination vacation.

This situation isn’t sustainable for birds or humans. 

Thanks to the pollution caused by buses and trains, it’s unhealthy for birds nesting there. Additionally, transit stations are a dangerous, disruptive environment to raise nestlings. A steady diet of human food isn’t good for birds, either.

It’s also bad for the city. Passengers waiting to board the bus are constantly pestered by birds. Employees are saddled with an immense, hazardous workload when it comes to cleanup.

The mess that birds leave behind is highly damaging to infrastructure, which costs the city more money.

Common solutions to bird problems include netting, spikes, snakes, but they’ve all been tried before. Unfortunately, these solutions can be ineffective, intrusive, and expensive. Covering open areas, like the three acres worth of 4th Street Transit Station in Reno–is simply impractical.

The best way to approach bird control is to incorporate it into initial designs.

The Regional Transportation Commission of Washoe County incorporated bird control into its initial design plan for the 4th Street Transit Station in Reno. During drafting, they planned how they’d control their issues using BirdBuffer. 

The BirdBuffer vapor-based solution produces a safe irritant for birds that signals they should stay away. Covering an open area with netting is ineffective and unattractive for any city, so they needed a different solution.

These spaces face unique challenges because the airflow is so diverse. To combat this, the Transportation Commission established BirdBuffer machines on each corner of the facility. They proactively installed these machines before food vendors came in.

Proactively planning bird control into your designs equals huge savings in time and money, which means a big budget difference. 

Our team of experts work with you to develop a comprehensive plan that will see a dramatic reduction in birds within 90 days. We can help you add BirdBuffer to your existing deterrent products like nets and spikes to amplify the effects and deter birds even better.

If you’re ready to learn more about how BirdBuffer helps safely deter birds away from your transit station, utility substation, airplane hangar, food processing facility, or commercial warehouse space, check out our website:

"There’s a new industrial plant proposed for Allens Ave. The nearest neighborhoods - primarily the Washington Park and South Side communities - already face some of the most dangerous environmental degradation in the state, and children in this area have some of the highest asthma rates in RI. This new plant would make this situation dramatically worse, and runs counter to the goals outlined in the Providence Climate Justice Plan   - it’s expected to receive 188 diesel truck deliveries every day, and to bring large quantities of dust and exhaust to an already-polluted area. 

We are showing up to the City Planning Commission meeting to stand in solidarity with the South Side/Washington Park community, and to voice our opposition to this new plant.

"The Salina Drive-thru Recycling Center (SDRC) will reopen tomorrow (Wednesday, June 3) with several modifications to its operating hours and procedures, resulting from expected budget shortfalls due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the April safer-at-home order. 

The previous restriction on plastic bags for transporting recyclables has been removed.

Temporary Hours of Operation
• Wednesday through Friday, 8 a.m. to 4 p.m.
• Saturdays, 8 a.m. to noon

Plastic Bags
• City Commissioners voted unanimously to allow the continued use of plastic bags to drop off recyclables.
• The previous restriction on plastic bags for transporting recyclables has been removed.
• Customers may once again drop off their recyclables in plastic or paper bags, cardboard boxes, baskets, bins or tubs; staff requests that materials are brought in an approved container.

Vehicle Traffic
• Long lines are expected during the first few weeks. Please be patient as we work to process a higher than normal amount of recyclables.
• There may be two lines formed with separate trucks within the fenced-in area, one inside the building and one outside the building (on the north side) to help facilitate a larger number of customers.
• Motorists may be directed to turn left (south) when exiting the facility onto the gravel area to prevent traffic jams from the anticipated line of cars and the construction on North Street between Santa Fe Avenue and North Ninth Street.
• As the number of customers is reduced, staff may return to its normal operation of a single lane of traffic inside the building only and allow exiting in either direction.

End-of-day Gate Closure
• At about 3:45 p.m. (Wednesday – Friday) and 11:45 a.m. (Saturdays), a staff member will walk the line of customers, if any, and inform them the facility will be closing in 15 minutes.
• At 4 p.m. on weekdays and noon on Saturdays, the gates will be closed. Anyone waiting in line outside the gates will have to come back when the facility is opened again.

If you have any questions, please call General Services at (785) 309-5750."

"The State of New Jersey wants to help homeowners reduce monthly energy bills and create a more sustainable future with solar power. 

After signing Executive order #28 and recently unveiling the state’s Energy Master Plan. All New Jersey townships are required to approve all qualified solar installations in an effort to reduce power consumption that contributes to climate change and save homeowners thousands on energy bills each year. 

Here’s absolutely EVERYTHING you need to know about solar power for your home: 

1. Since this is a state funded program, there is absolutely no out of pocket expense to convert your home to solar power if your home qualifies. 

2. You and your family will be protected from the rising costs of energy. 

3. You’ll no longer have to police the thermostat (live more comfortably, without increasing your family’s budget) 

4. You’ll feel good about making a positive environmental impact. 

5. The resale value of your home will increase significantly. 

Those five things alone will change your home, family and energy future forever... 

You only have to see if your home qualifies. 

Just click the link here:https://www.roof-check.malecki.solar/landing-page36796882 to check your qualifications and to be notified of the results. 

P.S. One last thing – it’s important you qualify your home now, the incentive program is on a first- come, first-serve basis and the State only has so many funds."
"The Tipping Point- Climate change, socially responsible investing, and your retirement. 
In “The Tipping Point”, Malcolm Gladwell describes how ideas spread like epidemics- slow at first, and then after reaching a point of critical mass, they accelerate.  We may be approaching the tipping point in green & socially responsible investing (SRI). If we as investors join the SRI movement, more and more pressure will be applied to CEOs and corporate boards.  As Larry Fink, of Blackrock funds stated this morning,”a fundamental reshaping of finance, with a significant reallocation of capital {is} set to take place”. Though Fink may be the fox watching the hen house, he does have an inside  view of Investing trends. Investors are increasingly demanding action in response to climate change- the defining issue of our lifetime.  Ongoing climate related disasters and social media are pushing the issue to the tipping point. As more and more investors join the movement there is another benefit, and it will directly impact your retirement. The potentially massive amounts of wealth that shift from average company stocks to the socially responsible stocks could create a scenario where SRI stocks outperform the rest of the market by a wide margin.  This is where you and your retirement benefit financially by doing the right thing. A look at clean energy stocks over the last 3 years may provide a clue to future trends. Between January 2017-Decemebr 2019, clean energy stocks gained 97%, while traditional energy stocks returned -9%.
Your investing dollars are more powerful than your vote-  don’t throw them into just any fund. Many “SRI”  mutual funds are loaded with traditional energy companies.  Stonebrook has been offering clients SRI solutions for 20 years and has many fossil free investing options. Join the movement! Your world and your retirement may depend on it.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
MAR 15, 2020

Warren needs to fix broken government

DEAR EDITOR:

As councilman representing people who elected me, I have a duty to protect our citizens by asking questions and holding officials and administrative directors accountable, particularly on health and safety. Raw sewage in basements is a pertinent subject.

At Wednesday’s council meeting, the director of Water Pollution Control (WPC) reported about the EPA calling him. He said an anonymous councilman reported sewage water in basements. That councilman was me. I called the EPA because neither the director, council committee Chairman Larry Larson nor council President Jim Graham had responded to many emails I sent.

During the meeting’s reports from directors, the WPC director referenced the last time the EPA was called it cost the city $70,000 because WPC was out of compliance. He blamed his predecessor, despite being the responsible party in charge for almost 10 years now.

WPC Director Haller said I was just looking out for my ward as if only the 5th Ward flooded and nobody else in the city did. He added I was being self-serving, attempting to seek help and guidance for the people and representing folks that have sewage in their basement.

On Sept. 13, the city experienced massive flooding of sewage into basements. A hearing was held in which WPC Director Haller promised to give results from $96,000 “study” to citizens in a January public hearing. This has not happened, despite that the “study” was delivered Dec. 31 to the EPA.

Mr. Haller has failed to respond to several emails from me. Chairman Larson failed to schedule hearings. There is no plan to address the city allowing sewage to back up into people’s basements. This is clearly a public health risk. Society’s best defense against disease is proper sewage treatment.

During the council meeting, when WPC Director Haller completed his report, I asked council President Graham to speak. He denied my request. This is highly usual.

I asked for a point of order, and the majority of city council voted against discussing this public health issue. As an elected representative, I was prohibited by our city council from doing our jobs. We should seek answers and solve problems for citizens. Sewage doesn’t recognize ward boundaries. This is a citywide problem that it seems President Graham would rather not address.

I believe the president was out of order, and by consequence, the entire council. Perhaps citizens need to look at a new form of government, like a charter. Perhaps our system is so badly broken we don’t hold ourselves accountable enough that we should seek to create a new form of government.

"The Tule Elk, native to California, are on the brink of extinction. Point Reyes National Seashore in Marin County is now the only national park where you can view these animals. Local beef and dairy operations, which lease 30% of the park, are pressuring the National Park Service to “manage” the wild elk through their relocation off the seashore and/or lethal removal.

At a time in our country and around the world, when so much wildlife is being decimated,  we ask the Park to protect the elk and its habitat and NOT cave to industry pressure.

Not only is the cattle industry listed as one of the leading threats for several endangered species, but it is noted as the highest emitter of greenhouse gasses in the National Seashore and has been the cause of high levels of pollution in the coastal watersheds, making California's most precious water systems also some of its most polluted. 

Let's be clear: this is NOT private land. This is public land. This is all of our land. And, especially with such a rich and sensitive ecosystem, we should protect it for its inherent value as wild landscape.

Monica Stevens, Jameson Animal Rescue Ranch CoFounder, asks you to take action now by  calling Congressman Huffman and signing the petition below to help us save the lives of the Tule Elk. Without your action, the cattle ranchers of Point Reyes will have the ability to kill the elk in order to “protect” ranching operations. Please help us give a voice to the voiceless.

"The typical US worker can no longer afford a family on a year's salary, showing the dire state of America's middle class. 

By Hillary Hoffower 
      Frank J Spotorno 
       Feb 27, 2020, 6:20 PM 

The American economy may be booming, but its middle class is struggling.

The median male US worker now has to earn more than a year's salary to afford the annual expenses for a family of four, according to ""The Cost of Thriving Index"" published by the Manhattan Institute, a conservative think tank, and previously reported by The Washington Post.  

In 1985, the typical male worker needed 30 weeks' pay to cover the $13,227 required for a family of four's major living costs: housing, healthcare, transportation, and education. As of 2018, those expenditures had risen to $54,441, and the typical male worker has to work 53 weeks to get there (shown in the chart below). ""This is a problem, as there are only 52 weeks in a year,"" Oren Cass, the report's lead author, wrote.

The index looked at the US Bureau Labor of Statistics' estimates for the median weekly earnings of men older than 25 who are employed full time as wage and salary workers.

Cass formulated the index on male earnings because men are historically considered the family breadwinners. His findings for a female breadwinner are even more telling: In 1985, she needed to work 45 weeks to afford the four annual expenses, compared with 66 weeks in 2018.

Both men and women are below the cost-of-thriving line in the above charts, as measured by the Manhattan Institute. That means a single-earner household cannot thrive on the median US income.

Living costs are outpacing wage increases

The ""Cost of Thriving Index"" points to tensions underlying the American economy, from the gender pay gap to skyrocketing living costs that have outpaced wage increases, particularly for younger generations. 

Those between ages 25 and 34 have seen only a $29 income increase since 1974, when adjusted for inflation, according to a new SuperMoney report that analyzed US Census Bureau data. Adults ages 35 to 44 made nearly $2,900 more in 2017 than their 1974 counterparts did, while those ages 45 to 54 saw an income growth of nearly $5,400 over that same time period, adjusted for inflation.

Meanwhile, college tuition has more than doubled since the 1970s, bringing the national student-loan debt to an all-time high of $1.5 trillion. According to Student Loan Hero, the average student-loan debt for a student who took out loans and graduated in 2018 was a whopping $29,800. 

The price of home sales has increased by 39% since the 1970s, and national healthcare costs per person have increased by $9,000 in the same time frame, according to the SuperMoney report. 

The increase in so many disparate costs shows that middle-class Americans carry several financial burdens — they're behind on homeownership, lagging in retirement savings, and have debt to pay off, according to a previous Insider and Morning Consult survey.

When all the paychecks from one year don't pay off a family's living costs, our typical male worker will feel he's living paycheck to paycheck, but it's actually worse than that.

A few months ago, I took my money out from the stock market. I felt something wrong was going to happen. I did always have had on the back of my head these developing countries have no environmental protection laws and have always known their health care system wasn’t the best. But not too long ago I didn’t put trust into these countries where if an outbreak was to occur, the world’s economy may suffer and our world health organization couldn’t do anything about any major illnesses, especially if a pandemic was to occur due to their past performances. 

I’m one of the lucky ones. I didn’t lose a nickel. But I’ve gained $107.23 cents. in these past few days. 

The covid 19 virus 🦠 is attacking humans and live stock. Why we took so long, since it was first heard of, over six weeks, is beyond me? It’s a lesson we need to heed by for history had always found ways to repeat itself. My health hasn’t changed. I’m still home. But my mind is still as whipped as it has always been, on top of things where others take our days and life for granted. 

We can’t do anything where our products are either being outsourced or are offshored. But we can retrieve what we lost, our dignity for giving our jobs away. In 1996, I myself was offered the opportunity to move to Mexico 🇲🇽, a stone throw from our borders. I almost took the bait. But....in the end, although the money 💰 looked great, what good is it, I thought, if we didn’t have consumers who couldn’t afford it. I wasn’t thinking about then, I was thinking about our future, as more and more companies jumped on the bandwagon. 

And my other concern was the health factor these developing countries had. It wasn’t like ours. And being at a time when Mexico 🇲🇽 was very poor, it wasn’t the risk I was willing to take traveling back and forth. My final analysis, what good is cheap if one can’t afford cheap. And than I thought to myself, does it make a difference what side of the globe starts to rot? Eventually, the entire globe will rot. For over three decades not only we have been exploiting human rights, but we have been killing our global environment, our global eco system. 

Lakes have deteriorated and dried up. Rivers across our globe are polluted. Our oceans 🌊, are literally dying. The waste that have been disposed into our oceans for over three decades has caused enormous affects on our sea life, their oxygen levels and increasingly ineffective eliminating our carbon emissions from our atmosphere. Our land forest is 50% gone. Our oceans once was the primary source of inhaling our carbon emissions, a rate that has been long estimated at 65% is no longer within that percentage. Our land forest was our secondary source of inhaling our carbon emissions, estimated at 35%. Today, 50% of our forest is gone. The sea life, our oceans are no longer effectively inhaling 65% of the world’s carbon emissions. Therefore what they can’t inhale how would they exhale the oxygen needed to sustain our sea life in our oceans? We now have blind spots, otherwise known as dead zones They are hypoxic (low-oxygen) areas in the world's oceans and large lakes, caused by ""excessive nutrient pollution from human activities coupled with other factors that deplete the oxygen required to support most marine life in bottom and near-bottom water.

Just as I put aside my greed and pursuit of the almighty dollar, it’s time American companies and foreign companies invests in countries where human rights are protected, environmental protection laws are well within reached and most of all, we have the best health care personal in the entire world 🌎. 

Going green is past our tipping point. We need to bring our jobs home and reinvest in our factories here, enforce our environmental laws, locally and globally, and definitely start the mass  clean up of our oceans, rivers and land fills. Reforestation our land across the globe 🌎 must be put to work at a pace unlike seen before. We must limit the use of carbon emissions immediately until our oceans are once again able to inhale our carbon emissions and our land forest once again to do the same. 

Carbon emissions is very important to our oceans and our land forest, for without it, humans and sea life cannot exist. Why? What they breath in, they exhale oxygen. Something many Americans and billion of people across our globe 🌎 are unaware. 

I’m going to reach out to the Trump administration and offer solutions to combat our climate problems, one ☝️ by bringing our jobs home, offering all foreign companies the same opportunity to manufacture their products in a nation that does not overlook human rights and our environmental protection laws, and leading the fight on the covid 19 virus 🦠. It’s too late to wait for the November elections. We need to act now. 

We can win this battle. It will take the combine forces of all our best scientists and start by re-investing in America, the land of opportunity.

Besides painting my environmental pictures, I've found another way fight Climate Change. I have formed a partnership with OneTreePlanted, an environmental non-profit that plants trees in blighted areas around the world. I've pledged a portion of every sale of my artwork toward planting trees, one of the best solutions to exacerbate the effects of Global Warming. 

I've loaded up my van with an unprecedented volume of my environmental artwork and I'll be leaving Tuesday morning for a barnstorming tour of eight Florida art fairs. I hope to sell a lot of artwork and plant a lot of trees in the coming months. If you're in Florida this winter, look for me at these terrific art fairs:

Jan 31-Feb 2 - Artfest Ft Myers - Ft.Myers, FL
Feb 8-9 - Bonita Springs Art Festival - Bonita Springs, FL
Feb 14-16 - Arti Gras Art Festival - Jupiter, FL
Feb 22-23 - Naples National Art Festival - Naples, FL
Mar 7-8 - Bonita Springs Art Festival - Bonita Springs, FL
Mar 13-15 - Under the Oaks Art Show - Vero Beach, FL
Mar 21-22 - Downtown Naples Art Fair - Naples, FL
Mar 28-29 - Santa Fe College Spring Art Festival - Gainsville, FL

The LebenArt Gallery, at 23 Center Street in downtown Douglas, Michigan, will be open all winter while I'm in Florida. You can also see (and purchase) all my work online at LebenArt.com where you can also read my new illustrated eBook, ""The Tree Museum."""

This is Mega, L-41. He was one of the Southern Resident Orcas. He was lost to us this year. There are so few left, so very few. They are starving. The salmon they feed on are starving.

"This is the day we have been planning for!  Hundreds of people across the state have been organizing to recruit 10,000 people to Caucus for the Climate.  

Click here for all the tools: http://bit.ly/caucusonepager

Commit to Caucus for Climate: www.bit.ly/commitcaucus 

Find your precinct caucus location: www.bit.ly/mnprecinct 

The 2020 election is around the corner, and this is the year where the climate crisis must be a top priority for voters – in order to create the sweeping change needed to cut emissions 50% by 2030. Throughout the year we’ll act together to build popular momentum to ‘Prioritize Climate’, sharing key actions to help make climate a top election issue for Minnesotans and build a mandate for bold action in 2021.

The first opportunity is to attend your precinct caucuses on February 25 and make sure climate is a top priority for your party.

Here is the text of the resolution that people are using:

Resolution Title: 100% Clean Energy in Minnesota

Whereas, everyone is impacted by the climate crisis, but some Minnesotans are experiencing it first and worst, 

Whereas, Minnesota is not on track to meet our commitment to cut greenhouse gas emissions 80% by 2050, 

Whereas, we need to cut global carbon dioxide emissions to net zero by at least 2050 in order to limit global warming to 1.5°C, 

Whereas, a just transition to a 100% equitable & clean energy future would benefit everyone, black, brown, or white, indigenous or immigrant, every gender, every part of the state, 

BE IT RESOLVED, that the           (party name)            supports: 
Transitioning to a 100% equitable and clean energy economy in Minnesota, in a way that reduces racial, gender, & economic disparities, resulting in zero carbon emissions by 2050

"This photo is not edited, not filtered, no adjustments at all. The smoke from the pacific poured in and smothered Jackson and Teton National Park. It is devastating to know how much land has burned to produce this amount of smoke! It breaks my heart knowing our earth is burning and we played a major part in the cause! Climate change has always felt overwhelming, but I’ve learned that if we all, together, make small changes in our lives - ride your bike to work, use less plastic, eat less red meat - we can have an impact! My dad always tells me his favorite quote “you don’t need to do great things, just small things in a great way!” That never seemed more inspiring than today!

I hope that you're starting this week in good spirits! Sometimes it's hard to appreciate the positives during these dark times, but consider this:⠀
⠀
Did you know that China has seen blue skies for the first time in years? Limited transportation due to the lockdown from COVID has enabled a reduction in carbon emissions, bringing blue skies back to China. ☀️☀️NASA Satellite images show atmospheric changes because of closed cities and factories. Even Los Angeles is seeing a significant drop in air pollution and bluer skies.⠀
⠀
The Earth is able to breathe and reset. The planet is probably happier than it's been  in a long, long time. 🌎☺️♥️🙌🏻⠀
⠀
What are YOU doing to make yourself happier? It's easier said than done, but it's important to reflect and appreciate the positives that are happening despite these dark times. What are you doing with this time? Are you getting caught up in the news, or reading a good book? Are you sitting on the couch, or getting outside to exercise? Take care of yourself.

"Three ways to fight climate change in your household?
1. Ask your utility company about buying clean electricity: you may not know exactly how much of your electricity is coming from renewable energy. So now's the time to find out.
2. Use a programmable thermostat: invest in an automatic thermostat that will help you be efficient and ensure the temperature at home stays at a comfortable level- not too hot, not too cold. 
3. Wash clothes in cold water: approximately 75% of the total energy use and greenhouse-gas emissions produced by a single load of laundry comes from warming the water itself. That's unnecessary, especially as studies have shown that washing in cold water is just as effective as using warm.
Do you already do any of these tips? Do you have other tips to be energy efficient at home?

#notmeus #vote 

***

California's primary elections are less than a month away! We believe this year's election is important for climate justice. From the presidential race to county supervisor races, Californians are faced with choices of candidates who will determine the future of both people and planet.

ENDORSEMENTS:

Democratic Presidential Nominee: Senator Bernie Sanders

350 Santa Barbara endorses Senator Bernie Sanders as the Demoratic party nominee for President. Bernie's vision of a national Green New Deal and his call of #NotMeUs reminds us that not only is another world possible, but that it is our collective responsibility to fight for and build that world together. Bernie's Green New Deal plan is the only candidate plan that will make the necessary cuts in greenhouse gas emissions to avoid the worst affects of climate change and will build a just transition for workers and communities.

Santa Barbara County, 3rd District Supervisor: Joan Hartmann

Incumbent Supervisor Hartmann is running for her second term as County Supervisor for the large and diverse third district. County supervisors have the final vote on all energy projects -- from continued oil development to the build out of renewable energy. Supervisor Hartmann's primary opponent -- Bruce Porter -- recieved $60,000 from oil interests in the 2016 election and has written about his desire to bring Santa Barbara's voters ""farm-to-table petroleum."" If Porter wins the election, it is likely that 750 new oil wells in Cat Canyon will be drilled and Exxon Mobil will be given the green light to build an oil pipeline along Gaviota coast to replace the one that ruptured in 2015 and turn back on its 3 offshore oil wells.

**

Both Santa Barbara County and this country desperately need a fair and just transition -- one in which we move from fossil fuels to renewable sources of energy, in which workers are guaranteed well-paying, safe, and dignified jobs, and which the historical inequalities that have made climate change possible are addressed. An election alone won't create the just transition. Yet it will be that much easier to build toward if we avoid a pro-oil majority on the Board of Supervisors and have a President committed to building a Green New Deal.

Elections are just step 1. The organizing will continue long after."
"To All My Loyal Customers & New Customers. PLEASE READ ENTIRE POST. 

I just found this post I Copied & Pasted it thought it would be interesting to share with everyone!!! 

The official lockdown started March 23 and will likely end May 1st. That is EXACTLY 40 days.

The Latin root of the word ""quarantine"" is ""forty"".
So what does the Bible say about 40?

The flood lasted 40 days.
40 years Moses fled Egypt.
40 days Moses stayed on Mount Sinai to receive the Commandments.
Exodus lasted 40 years.
Jesus fasted for 40 days.
40 days for a woman to rest after giving birth.

Optimum number of weeks for human gestation is 40.

A group of theologians thinks the number 40 represents ""change”. It is the time of preparing a person, or people, to make a fundamental change.
Something will happen after these 40 days. Just believe and pray. Remember, whenever the number 40 appears in the Bible, there is a ""change"".

Please know that during this ""quarantine"" rivers are cleaning up, vegetation is growing, the air is becoming cleaner because of less pollution, there is less theft and murder, healing is happening, and most importantly, people are turning to Christ. The Earth is at rest for the first time in many years and hearts are truly transforming.

Remember we are in the year 2020, and 20 + 20 = 40.

Also, 2020 is the year of the United States Census. Jesus Christ, the savior of the world, was born during a census.

Lastly, 2020 is perfect vision. May our sight focus on the Lord and living according to His perfect vision for us knowing He holds us in the palm of His hand.

May these days of ""quarantine"" bring spiritual liberation to our souls, our nation, and our world.

 ❤️❤️❤️"
"Today I interview Adrian Ayres Fisher, sustainability coordinator at Triton College in River Grove, Illinois about ""Carbon Gardening.""  An easy, do-it-yourself method for extracting carbon dioxide gas from the atmosphere, carbon gardening could collectively have a big impact on global warming: if we all carbon gardened, we could reduce CO2 emissions by as much as a third -- and nurture wildlife and native plants at the same time.  Check it out on ""Growing Greener"" at ThomasChristopherGardens.com"
"Today is a day that is close to our hearts. It’s is Arctic Sea Ice Day, and our keepers put out some tasty enrichment for Hope and Nora as part of an awareness effort to bring to light the issues listed below by Polar Bears International.

“The Arctic is warming twice as fast as the rest of the planet, causing the sea ice to melt. Polar bears rely on sea ice to hunt, breed, and sometimes den. We created Arctic Sea Ice Day, on July 15th, to draw attention to the meltdown taking place in the Arctic, why it matters, and how we can reverse this trend. 

Each year is different in the Arctic, a process called inter-annual variation. To see changes and trends, scientists  look at long-term datasets. Decades of data show that there is a warming trend in the Arctic, with resulting sea ice loss. Climate warming is happening at different rates and times across the Arctic. The resulting sea ice changes impact polar bears differently depending on age, body condition, reproductive status, and local pressures including pollution and harvest.”

"Today is world’s ocean today 🌊 
Don’t turn your back but rather be part of change. Say no to single use plastic, choose brands you support wisely. Every little step counts, every single use cup or water bottle counts. 🌎 after some research and reflection I want to make more effort at choosing clothing brands. First of all I really DO NOT need new clothes 😉 but if I decide to get some I want to support sustainability. Recently I found app @goodonyou_app which breaks down effort that brands do in three categories- sustainability, labor, animals. 🌱 I am not saying I can be perfect and only buy from sustainable brands and not produce any plastic pollution but every small change by every person counts. 🤍🌊 hopefully you can get inspired as well 🌊🤍"
"Today marks one month that #OceanVoyagesInstitute has been on the high seas removing toxic plastic pollution from the #NorthPacificGyre.

OVI crew members are presently working hard cleaning up an area high in debris density comprised of polymer nets and consumer plastic waste within the Gyre.

Despite being hampered by some inclement weather, #SVKWAI has achieved promising milestones in the last 4 weeks particularly during sunny, calm days, including collecting more plastic debris than our 2019 gyre expedition which set an area record (42 TONS) as well as loading over 12 tons of plastic debris in a SINGLE day! SV KWAI is already at half cargo capacity, with over 63 large net bags filling the hold and counting.

Innovations in satellite intel combined with modelling are beginning to show promise to increase our efficiency in retrieving debris, thanks to National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and a collaborative testing consortium of companies trying to identify and predict ocean debris locations, adding to our ongoing success in retrieving nets found by our satellite trackers which lead us to good collection areas.

Great thanks to Dr Nikolai Maximenko and Dr Jan Halfner, expert modelers of debris distribution, who OVI is grateful to for over 11 years of collaboration.

Ocean Voyage Institute expects SV KWAI to return to Honolulu around June 20th to offload plastic from Leg 1 of the North Pacific Gyre Clean-up.

It is estimated between 4.8 and 12.7 million tonnes of plastic enter the World's Oceans each year, (Journal Science, 2015).

Please help Ocean Voyages Institute / Project Kaisei expand critical clean-up work in the world's gyres, and support a second leg THIS SUMMER to remove additional tons of toxic plastics from the North Pacific Ocean allowing further progress and innovation in locating large nets from space by donating here:

"Today, we are in the throws of yet another election. First, we must register to vote or confirm, no matter where you live in the US, that you are STILL a registered voter. 

Next, we must learn about the candidates that are running for President. We must be diligent or we will loose yet again. This is NOT the time to be careless or fickle. We MUST GET IT RIGHT!

Here are the five people still in the race - of those, only three have a chance to win. So, I have decided to focus on those three because WE MUST GET IT RIGHT!

First, Senator Bernie Sanders from VT. He is for early childhood education (at no cost), universal single-payer healthcare (everyone should be able to have healthcare as a right, not a privilege), and supports green new deal and climate change measures, and knows that plenty of jobs for this initiative will be just around the corner. He also supports the unions. Some may not know that he supported SNCC (Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee during the 1960's). The only thing that might be noted as well is that he is against Reparations for our pain and suffering.

Next, former Vice President Joe Biden. Although he served this country for almost half a century, his record speaks for itself. However, here are some low and high-points: A former US Senator '73 until 2009, he oversaw the case of Professor Anita Hill, and now Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas. He is also known for backing the war in IRAQ after 911, but not backing a surge of troops in 2007 to help end the war. On the other hand, he did help pass the Violence Against Women Act. He also led the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act, which put more money into prisons instead of into prevention. Something to think about, right?:"

"Tribes in the upper Midwest have been at the forefront of developing novel strategies to respond to climate change, mitigate threats to critical ecosystems, protect traditional subsistence and harvesting practices, and advance Tribal resource, energy, and food sovereignty.

LGN Associates Laura Matson and Arielle Wagner moderated a panel titled “Tribal Food and Resource Sovereignty in the context of Climate Change.” The panel featured Bradley Harrington (Minnesota Department of Natural Resources), Michael Northbird (Minnesota Chippewa Tribe), and Philomena Kebec (Great Lakes Indian Fish and Wildlife Commission). The panelists highlighted work being done on reservations, in state government, and in the treaty-ceded territories to revitalize Ojibwe cultural practices, develop food and resource sovereignty plans, and respond to environmental conditions and climate change impacts. The panel touched on issues of treaty law, food safety protocols and agricultural policy, and state/tribal cooperation around environmental initiatives.

This CLE was co-hosted by the Minnesota American Indian Bar Association and the MSBA Environmental, Natural Resources, and Energy Law Section."
"TRIGGER WARNING: THE INTENT OF THIS POST IS TO MODEL A CONFESSION TO WHITE PEOPLE. THIS POST MAY TRIGGER BLACK PEOPLE AND THEREFORE PLEASE DO NOT READ IF OUR CONFESSIONS UNNECESSARILY BURDEN YOU. THIS IS OUR WORK TO DO, NOT YOURS. 

WE ARE ALLIES. 

We lift up and support black Americans at any cost, including the cost of relationships, the cost of our social standing in our local communities, the cost of our jobs, the cost of our resources (as we believe the black community is owed reparations by this country and therefore US for the torture they have endured for 401 years), the cost of our time, energy, and pride (as we battle our fragile white egos in the race discussion). 

In step one of the 12 steps to recovery in AA, it is stated that there is no other disease that has warped the alcoholic’s mind quite like alcoholism. However, we believe that the disease of racism is of even greater peril and destruction to its host (us), our families, our communities, and our country.

Therefore, as per these 12 steps to recovery, we first admit we are powerless over our disease and that we came to believe a Power greater than ourselves could restore us to sanity. We believe we must make a decision to turn our will and our life over to God or the Divine and take a searching and fearless moral inventory of ourselves. Therefore, we admit to God, to ourselves, and to society, the very nature of our wrongs. 

We admit we do not know and will never know what it is like to be oppressed to the point of numbness to having our rights violated and our dignity exploited. We apologize and seek to not be defensive when we are corrected by a black brother or sister. We acknowledge that generations of Americans have passed down a message and subsequently  conditioned us to believe we are the dominant race. We confess that we centered ourselves at every turn, not only in our country, but in the world. Therefore, we admit to our addiction of superiority and “special-ness.” 

We confess to  believing we could save you from being black. We confess we always thought our cultural norms and the way we speak was superior to yours. We confess to believing we cornered the market on beauty and intelligence and that we silently thought you cornered the market on music, dance, and sports. We confess that we exploited your talent at every turn and masked this exploitation in saving you and subsequently tried to own and control the impact of your talent. We admit that you work twice as hard as us to receive half the credit.  We confess that you could run the company you’ve been employed by for 20 years, but that were we to exalt you to your rightful position, we would no longer feel in control and subsequently our whole construct of WHO we are (superior) may begin to crumble. 

We admit that we believed we worked hard to get to third base; but really, we were born here. 

We confess  we used to lock our doors at the sight of you because our parents and their parents believed the lie fed to us by media that you were born with a disposition to crime.  We admit we were scared when we passed you on the sidewalk. We confess we were addicted to our assumptions, our ignorance... our racist beliefs (despite the unrest we felt) because were we to examine this construct... were we to get to know you... then we would be faced with the dark reality of the most heinous sin: dehumanizing you. 

We confess that we thought that your joy was an affront to our placid exteriors and inner turmoil. We confess that we’ve stereotyped and generalized your race at every turn because this is so much easier than seeing you as an individual with your own story, hopes, aspirations, and goals, and subsequently admitting to our racism. We confess we thought you were exaggerating when you told us you were being profiled and that we minimized your experience by explaining to YOU why YOUR truth was false while simultaneously and ignorantly proclaiming, “How can we still have racism in a country who had its first black president?!”

We confess we never asked you. 

We admit we made you feel like our skin and our hair was better by centering ourselves in all of our advertisements, media, entertainment, and in our conversations with you and your children, exerting our power over you by touching your hair, commenting on your skin tone, and burdening you with our questions and statements instead of doing the work necessary to understanding WHY these things are not okay to do.  

We  admit we didn’t hire you because you made us uncomfortable and threatened the very reality we’ve built our entire success upon. We confess we laughed at a racist joke at one point in our lives. We admit that we have hyper-sexualized you, exploiting your young girls and discussing false narratives about the genitalia of your men and women.  We confess we disproportionately disciplined your young boys in school for the same behaviors their white counterparts got away with, sending so many of them swiftly into the dark and hopeless pipeline to the criminal justice system... a system that has tried over and over to strip your men of their dignity, worthiness, and belonging in their families and in their country. 

We acknowledge that you’ve patiently and enduringly given us chance after chance to make it right... to just see you as equals. And we acknowledge that at every turn, you were met with the word “Wait.” We acknowledge that you have been patient. We admit that if we were in your shoes, we would have rebelled by now. We admit you’ve been kind, patient, and forgiving at every turn. We admit that we wouldn’t last a day in your shoes. 

We admit we have masked our fear of these truths being exposed in patriotism and “pride.”  We admit we are scared that if you really knew what we thought (whether as a current racist or as a recovering racist) that you would murder every last one of us. We admit that since we were born into this condition, with this disease, that questioning it feels like questioning our own existence. We confess that everything we’ve built in this country has been at your expense, because we believed we had the inherent and unalienable right to own you. To raise your children. To tell your story. 

As white people born with the disease of racism, we state we are “sick and tired of being sick and tired” and we are entirely ready to have God remove all these defects of character.

We commit to humbly asking the Divine to remove our shortcomings. We commit to taking inventory of the ways we have harmed you and we commit to making direct amends  wherever possible, except when to do so would injure you.  We commit to continue to take personal inventory DAILY and when we are wrong, we commit to promptly admit it."

"TV: Das, Laura Clash on Pot, Political Reform & Public Schools

The first face-to-face confrontation between Das Williams and Laura Capps played out on the Newsmakers TV set Tuesday night, a contentious but respectful one-hour discussion of key issues in their race for supervisor in SB County's First District.

At the center of the exchange, moderated by host Jerry Roberts, was Santa Barbara County’s controversial cannabis ordinance, and Supervisor Williams’ pivotal role in crafting it, as he and SB school board President Capps tangled over its impact on public schools, public health and public trust in local government.

While pot dominated the early portion of the conversation, the rivals also aired their views – and even found occasional agreement – on a host of other public policy matters, including climate change, public safety, the Montecito debris flow disaster, child poverty, homelessness and housing.

Tuesday night’s program is the first of four events in which the two candidates will meet in coming weeks, as the Montecito Journal, Santa Barbara Independent and League of Women Voters all are sponsoring forums featuring the two. Because there are only two candidates on the March 3 ballot, the First District election is a winner-take-all contest, with no November runoff.

"Two years ago, Insular Empire co-directors Amy Elizabeth Robinson and Vanessa Warheit ran a GoFundMe to help friends in the CNMI after they were hit by Supertyphoon Yutu, the strongest storm to ever hit US soil. Last week, Amy’s house burned down in the #GlassFire - part of the complex of giga-fires that have burned over 4 million acres in California this year. Climate change is everywhere, and it spares no one. Amy and her family are safe, but they lost everything, and their insurance was minimal. Please chip in if you can to help them rebuild:

"Using Native Plants as the basis of our agricultural system we can return biodiversity to cropland, mitigate climate change through increased carbon sequestration and increased land use efficiency, all the while produce more human-utilized food per acre than modern agriculture. This concept is known as Native Plant Agriculture or NPA - the implementing of edible native plants and native animals as the basis of a primarily perennial agricultural system while mimicking native plant communities in format.

The Pictures below show a small spectrum of the native plant agricultural crops relevant to the Eastern half of the United States: Muscadine Grapes, Virginia Spiderwort, PawPaw, Native Plums, Shagbark Hickory, Common Persimmon, Wood Nettle, Passionflower, Pecan, Sunflower, Fox Grapes - 'Concord', Cut-Leaf Coneflower, Blueberry, and Common Milkweed. 

Considering just high-potential crops; in the Eastern Half of the U.S. there are over 35 species of native fruit crops, 40+ species of native vegetable crops, and over 25 species of native nut and seed crops. That's a total of 100+ high-potential Native Plant Food Crop species. 

With Native Plant Agriculture restoring native trees, shrubs, vines, and herbaceous plants on cropland we have the opportunity to support biodiversity while growing food for human use. You can learn about Native Plant Agriculture through our Native Plant Agriculture Vol. 1 book; see the option purchase here: https://indigescapes.com/npabook

"VDAY El Paso Joins the Global Movement to Stop Violence Against Women and Girls

V-Day El Paso 2020
Presents a Benefit Reading of

A Memory, A Monologue, A Rant, & A Prayer: Writings to Stop Violence Against Women and Girls

This is a groundbreaking collection of monologues by world-renowned authors and playwrights, edited by Eve Ensler and Mollie Doyle.
""Each piece captures a spirit of being human in a series of recognizable situations, provoking empathy for those involved and heightening our awareness of why and how such things come to pass."" -Theatre Review New Zealand

Proceeds benefit Borderland Rainbow Center and Frontera Water Protection Alliance. 

From the VDAY website:
""Welcome to V-Season 2020

V-Day, the global movement to end violence against all women and girls (cisgender, transgender, and those who hold fluid identities that are subject to gender based violence) has seen its work evolve over the past three years. The rise of misogynist, authoritarian regimes the world over - from the United States to the Philippines, India to Brazil - has recalibrated our work, further escalating the urgency with which we feel compelled to fight for gender, climate, economic and racial justice.

We are in the midst of a rising tide of right-wing nationalism, white supremacy, fascism, tyranny, hatred of and fear of immigrants, misogyny, femicide, homophobia, transphobia, corporate greed and climate destruction. We cannot beat these violators on their terms. We will never be that cruel, discompassionate, greedy, or murderous. We cannot let ourselves be changed by or sunk in their cynicism, hatred, divisions and destruction.

What we can do is remember we are the many and we can RAISE THE VIBRATION through Action, Art, Connection, Imagination and Love.

That is why we do theater, music, art, poetry, dance.
That is why we stand in the face of injustice and are just.
That is why call out the systems that create insane inequality and we give more.
That is why we open the borders of our heart when the state builds walls, detention centers and refugee camps.
That is why we reach out to include everyone in our circle of rising as the state creates further and further divisions between us.
That is why we devote ourselves to developing trust and solidarity, to joining our issues in solidarity, because this bond, once secure becomes our wings.
That is why we move our bodies so that the freedom and energy we shake loose becomes a new energy bringing in a new future.
That is why we see, cherish, nurture, respect and protect our Mother Earth as we are not separate from her. Her life is our life.

Together, we RISE to free all women (cisgender, transgender, and those who hold fluid identities) from sexual, physical, racial, economic, political, socio-cultural, ideological and climate crisis violence. We RISE to end rape, battery, incest, sexual harassment, female genital mutilation, sexual slavery and trafficking, child marriage, femicide, sexual, gender and reproductive oppression, violence towards LGBTQIA+ communities. We RISE to end capitalism, colonization, racism, imperialism, climate catastrophe and war.

"Very proud to present our premiere of 
TRANS PECOS | 
The Story of Stolen Land and the 
Loss of America’s Last Frontier 
@transpecosdoc 📽 Sunday, February 23rd 
at the Stateside Theater
in Austin, TX

Our film sets out to uncover the truth of the controversial Trans Pecos Pipeline while creating a poetic portrait of Far West Texas and the American people whose lives and land the pipeline has affected. The story is woven of a diverse fabric of an insider, landowners, concerned citizens of different colors, classes and creeds - some of which come from the oil and gas industry itself.

TRANS PECOS is a story about the unexpected bipartisan alliances that occur when companies place private gain before public good.

The grassroots support behind TRANS PECOS attempts to find common ground in a way that strengthens citizen engagement and civic bridges. It is a story of how one natural gas pipeline in Far West Texas can act as a conduit of change between informed citizens and those in power as the future of natural resources and energy is decided. 
Huge thanks to our friends at @patagonia for supporting the premiere. 
Stay tuned for ticket info. 🎞

"Video in ENGLISH. Today’s positivity topic- loving, nurturing and embracing nature. Full video- https://youtu.be/MWZ4f1F2TsA subscribe to my YouTube channel for more lovely videos and recipes 🌸🌿. I love nature because I am a part of it. When I spent time in natural surroundings, it feels like nature and the environment nurtures and embraces me. So why shouldn’t I do the same to nature as well, by embracing and nurturing it, instead of destroying it? I love and respect myself with utmost devotion and care, I am able to love and take care of my surroundings, those around me and nature too. We can all co-exist peacefully. We should all co-exist peacefully. 

Earth and nature is available abundantly, but whether to nurture it or destroy it is a choice. We share the world with many different species and Nature is also home to many different forms of LIFE. Again we have the same choice or whether to nurture or to destroy. By destroying nature we are also destroying the natural homes and shelters of wildlife. Is it right to destroy their habitat just because they cannot speak or express their feelings like we are able to? 

According to Wikipedia, “A habitat is an ecological or environmental area that is inhabited by a particular species of animal, plant, or other type of organism. The term typically refers to the zone in which the organism lives and where it can find food, shelter, protection and mates for reproduction. 

As we make more room for people, for example, by destroying trees to build furniture or to make more land space to build houses to live in or to construct huge buildings for business purposes to make profit, we often overlook the homes of other species and life forms that are being destroyed in the process.

When we destroy nature to do things for our benefit, but we often forget that by destroying natural habitats, which leads to global warming and climate change, we are also harming ourselves. Sudden destruction of habitat does not give the species living in that particular habitat a chance to adapt to the change, in turn causing chaos. 

We can overcome habitat loss by preserving natural resources and learning how to use them in a way that does not require frequent destruction of habitats. As we destroy a particular habitat, we should also put in the effort to rebuild and replace what is lost. For example, by building sanctuaries which mimic the natural habitats that were destroyed, in order to protect species of animal, plant, or other type of organism from extinction.  

In order to conclude, let’s always focus on preserving and protecting nature, the world and the environment we live in, as nature is preserving us in return."

"**WASTE! What is it good for?! Absolutely nothing!** When I started making soy candles, it was a conscious effort to minimize air pollution while I indulged. My sentiment to create less waste naturally translated to my business practices. I try to minimize waste in so many ways, and I want to share one of them with you today :-) This picture shows used up sheets of my @avery candle labels and you can see just how much good Kraft sticker paper was going to waste. So I found a round hole puncher on @amazon and now I use that to punch out as many holes as I can from each sheet (15-20!) for perfect little round kraft stickers! These are so multipurpose and I know I’m going to find a use for them! Im sure eventually the cost of individual little stickers will outweigh the cost of the hole puncher, but the whole point is, I am using what I have as much as I can - and it will create for better packaging!

This is a really good hack from small business owners or crafters who make their own labels. Be resourceful and create less waste! 
I’d love to know how other business owners minimize waste in their own ways! Let me know, I’m always looking for ideas! .

"We are accustomed to hearing the three R's of recycling: reduce, reuse, recycle, for paper, plastic, bottles, cans, and cardboard, but most do not know that you can recycle metal as well. Recycling metal reduces pollution, saves resources, reduces waste going into landfills and prevents the destruction of habitats from mining new ore. 

So what can we do to help? ♻️

First, make the switch to steel from plastic! It's kinder to the planet, more durable than plastic, and resistant to rodents, rust and odor.

How are you improving your carbon footprint? 👣"
"We are all spending a lot of time indoors these days and the quality of our indoor air becomes more and more important to our health and well-being.  The Environmental Protection Agency has ranked indoor air pollution as one of the top 5 environmental dangers facing our planet.

According to the EPA, indoor environments are around 2-5 times as polluted as the air outdoors, and occasionally up to 100 times as dirty.

While there is little you can do to affect the quality of the air outdoors, there is a lot you can do to improve indoor air quality at home.  There are many different modifications you can make to your existing HVAC system to improve the quality of the air you breathe.

Air scrubbers can help improve air quality and can also be used as a permanent fixture inside of your existing ductwork.

ActivePure is based on technology originally developed by NASA and is proven to reduce up to 99% of surface micro-organisms and dramatically reduce airborne contaminants and allergens. Today, the technology is available to consumers, promoting healthier lives through its Beyond by Aerus family of products featuring ActivePure Certified Space Technology.

Cleaner air doesn’t just reduce rates of illness but also helps with allergies and asthma and even improves sleep. I’d like to share a personal testimony regarding the air scrubber installed in my family’s home: 

“We have a large family under one roof that includes 2 adults and five children (ages 16, 11, 10, 9 and 4), all of which transfer germs into the home from work, school, and daycare. I remember feeling overwhelmed because everyone in our home had been sick off and on for 2-3 months and continued to pass it around, regardless of how much we disinfected surfaces and washed our hands. I decided install air scrubber after learning about it from our HVAC distributor because something had to give. I am completely certain the air scrubber is keeping the germs and viruses at bay in our house and would recommend it for anyone looking to ensure the air quality in their home is safe.”

Roberts Service Co. is offering a furnace and air conditioner cleaning at no charge ($236.00 value) with the purchase of an air scrubber. What’s even more exciting is – for every two air scrubbers sold, Roberts Service Co.  will donate one air scrubber to a local non-profit or business providing care for seniors. Make everyday Senior Citizens day!

Give us a call 269-683-8549 to see how you can save money and support our community. Check out ActivePure online as well.

In light of the current situation of our nation, state, and local community, the Strittmatter team wants to ensure safety is a top priority to those throughout our community.

“We are taking every precaution necessary to ensure our team members are readily available to provide service to your family during this time of uncertainty. We have multiple safety protocols in place to ensure we are able to provide service, maintenance, and installation for your heating, cooling, and plumbing needs.

“If your air conditioner, heater, or water heater breaks down, call us and we’ll take care of it. If you have a clogged drain or plumbing leak, call us and we will get it fixed. One of our major focuses at this time is indoor air quality, as it is imperative to ensure your family is breathing clean, healthy air in your safe haven – your home.”"

So far, there is no response from government resources, as it is under pressure to make good, on high rent for the space.  The old location, in a large historical, beautiful house in Kirkwood had much more reasonable rent. It was demolished for 'progress', and took a herculanean feat to move tons of books to it's present place. The other photos are of my book signing event, where the red carpet and scarf were rolled out for me in February. (""Merferd Colors the World"" graphic novel coloring book).  I've put my money where my mouth and where the Merferds remain, and brought a donation by yesterday. (Ring the doorbell in the back). Remember, ""You don't know what you've got 'till it's gone.""

"Wednesday, October 28 @7pm 
Meet Josh and Rebecca Tickell, directors of ""Kiss the Ground"".
""A cure for climate change starts with a simple solution right under our feet.""

We're excited to announce that filmmakers and farmers Josh and Rebecca Tickell will be guest speakers at our upcoming online monthly meeting Wednesday, Oct. 28th @7pm. Josh and Rebecca directed and produced the 2020 Tribeca Film Festival Official Selection Kiss the Ground, narrated by Woody Harrelson. 

Hope you can join us! Please Register in advance. https://us02web.zoom.us/meeting/register/tZIuceuvqTwuHdLUenLObWhSnBlMfOnVlQu1

Josh Tickell is an internationally recognized author, film director, speaker and expert on sustainability and the climate. Over two decades of research culminated in his
best-selling book, Kiss the Ground, which presents cutting-edge solutions for sequestering the 1,000 gigatons of CO2 in our atmosphere and bringing balance to our climate.

Rebecca Harrell Tickell has dedicated her life to environmental activism through the medium of film. Her 2011 Official Cannes Selection documentary The Big Fix (2012) examines the BP Gulf Oil Spill and how America can get off of oil. She and Josh then directed and produced Pump (2014) and Good Fortune (2016).

The Tickells also founded Big Picture Ranch, an avocado farm nested in the Los Padres National Forest in Ojai, California which also operates 24/7 as a soup-to-nuts film studio.

Feel free to join us for this first portion of 350NYC's monthly general meeting and bring your questions. And of course you're welcome to stay on with us afterwards to learn about our current work and campaigns. Josh and Rebecca will speak starting @7:15pm followed by a Q&A.

"We have a serious plastic bag problem!

Starting out as fossil fuels, plastic bags go from a shopping convenience to deadly waste polluting our oceans and landfills. 
Plastic bags have become an American staple. According to @centerforbiodiv consumers use 100 billion plastic shopping bags a year but only 1% of all plastic bags are returned for recycling.

Over 100,000 marine animals are killed by plastic waste every year. Hungry animals like birds, sea turtles and fish often mistake shredded plastic bags for food, filling their stomachs with toxic debris. 
Plastic bags don’t seem like a big deal, especially when you use one at a time...but they add up! 
You don’t need to change your entire lifestyle to make a difference. Start with one simple change. Use reusable shopping bags or simply carrying items you purchase with your hands.

Changing habits that seem insignificant can actually have a major impact. We must do our part to prevent this harmful habit from continuing. Say no to single use plastics and start by making one simple change. .

"We have been working on this campaign to make it simple to understand. It's more than just climate change. Our WASTE is a major problem. Do you think of what happens to your trash when you throw it away? Most waste ends up in a landfill, burned in an incinerator, or recycled. However, waste collection is not a perfect process. In the US alone, we produce almost 300 million TONS of trash in one year. That's 821 Empire State buildings, 1,331 Royal Caribbean cruise ships, and more than 46 million African Bush elephants... If only .01% of that waste ended up in the environment, that is almost 30,000 tons of waste that contaminates the wildlife around us per year. In reality that percentage is much higher, and it looks like this.

I know it is frustrating because you are just one person. You are trying to live your life. You did not ask for products with materials that harm the environment. You just want products that function properly and serve their purposes. You don't care if its plastic. In fact, you wish it wasn't so you wouldn't have to worry about destruction like this. Yes, it is the manufacturers' job to produce less harmful material. However, they will not change until it affects their pocketbooks, and we demand change. WE as consumers have to change just as much as they do or we will not be taken seriously. A simple lifestyle change can go a long way. At www.newcenturysustainability.com we offer products to help you do that. 
#USEYOUROWN is a movement to cut simple waste like water bottles, coffee cups, plastic cutlery, and plastic toothbrushes. It may be slightly more inconvenient, but those are materials that contaminate the environment the most. Easily replaceable items that you can just carry around and reuse yourself. The more people you get to join this movement, the more impact it will have. Visit www.newcenturysustainablity and start a simple solution to plastic waste.

"Welcome to our opening event!

The time on this event is a deadline.

2020 is the mark of a new decade, and with that decade; change. But someone has to be the ones to start that change.

What’s our goal? 
Our goal is to ignite a fire of change that blankets the world. Not just for 2020 but for years and years to come. Indefinitely.🌎💚

How?
We’re pulling people together to remove 2020 tons of ocean pollution. That’s the weight of 81 fully loaded semi trucks, only a small fraction of what gets dumped in the ocean every year.

How can you help?
You can do your part by visiting TheTravelGames.com and donating even $1 and then share this event with your family and friends.
*If everyone donates $1 in just the state of California, that would be enough to hit this goal roughly 9 times over! That would be 36,360,000 million pounds.

Or, visit TheTravelGames.com/store and pick up merchandise. All of our merchandise is made from eco friendly and sustainable materials. We DO NOT participate in the creation of new plastics. And all proceeds are invested into this goal or others similar, be sure to read our product descriptions to find out more.

🚨
Lastly, if you need any more incentive. Every donation, every purchase, every newsletter signup is entered into a sweepstakes. Courtesy of The Travel Games. We’re giving away Vacations all throughout the year, all expenses paid for, and for groups of 6+, (depending of winners immediate family size).

We built the platform, but real change starts with you. Thank you.💙🌎💚"

"We only have one (Mother) Earth, so let's treat her right this Mother's Day, and every day. Here are a few simple, small steps we can each take to make a collective impact.⁠
⁠
🥑Buying only what you need helps reduce food waste (which, by the way, is the #1 way to curb climate change). And choosing Apeel fruits and veggies ensures that your produce is ready to eat when you are.⁠
⁠
💡Flip the switch! Turning off unused lights and electronics reduces carbon emissions, greenhouse gases, and how much you pay for your electric bill.⁠
⁠
🚿Take shorter showers to conserve both water and the energy required to heat it.⁠
⁠
🐄 Make Meatless Monday happen on Thursday (or Friday or Saturday). Raising livestock generates huge amounts of greenhouse gas emissions, so reducing your meat intake is healthy for both you and the planet."
"We only need $400 more for our initial Global Giving campaign by Wednesday!  These are some of the students that have benefitted from our school programs.  Kono Gnag works with local artists as well as local schools to integrate traditional dance programs in curriculums, fund research trips, and carry out professional development workshops with the artists.  Our programs provide income for local dancers and drummers in Mali as well as enhance the children’s education and  strengthen their community engagement and knowledge of their rich traditions. In the past year we bought land and have the plans set to build a dance and music center in Bamako that will provide more opportunities to local artists, communities, and students.  Solo wants to provide a place that will allow he and other artists to work with the street children as there are many children that are not in school.   The plans are to build the dance center with the local banco materials - the traditional mud bricks - that will help to greatly reduce the carbon footprint - a huge concern as climate change is already creating major agricultural problems in places like Mali.  .  We are just $400 short from reaching our initial goal so I am hoping you may be willing to give a contribution to help us get there.   Whatever you can do would be great!

"We're excited to announce The Outlaw Ocean Music Project, which is an innovative collaboration that melds music with journalism. We’ve enjoyed being a part of this project with Ian Urbina. 

Our upcoming release “Shadowlands” inspired by his book “The Outlaw Ocean” is out now everywhere: www.theoutlawoceanmusic.com/artists/ternion-sound

The emotions we keyed into this album were the feelings of tension and hopelessness that some of the imprisoned workers must feel at sea. Furthermore, these same emotions are mirrored when thinking about the vast amounts of pollution in our oceans and how to stop humanity from destroying our home. We hope that listeners engaging with the tracks we have created will amplify the stories presented in The Outlaw Ocean—the vastness and darkness of the oceans. We want this mood of melancholy hopelessness to move people to protect our planet and those who live on it."

"What can we do to protect the environment?

When viewed on an individual scale, people's ability to protect nature can be limited, but measures can be taken that can cause large differences at the mass level. Some of these measures:

- Most waste can be recycled and reused. To do this, the waste should be divided into glass, plastic, metal and battery waste. Waste separated before disposal can be reused, and the degree of occurrence of negative consequences can be significantly reduced. Waste management should be considered.

- In an industrial area, it is important to control gas emissions into the atmosphere. Since uncontrolled gases emit both air pollution and prepare the environment suitable for some environmental disasters.

- Unplanned construction is one of the most important effects. Because the skewed design brings a lot of environmental concerns. Contamination of clean water sources is one of these negative consequences.

- The utilization of renewable energy sources should be maximum. Non-renewable energy sources mean the irrational use of natural resources. On the one hand, when receiving energy, on the other hand, they try to eliminate the pollution that needs to be tested, and energy is spent on it.

- One of the most important issues that should be mentioned about the importance of ecology is the inadequate protection of forest areas. Forests can be described as the lungs of the world. Forests perform a very important task, filtering polluted air and producing oxygen."
"What “Communism” and “Socialism” really means to the Cons and Supremacists

For a long while I just figured that using the terms communism and socialism were just typical “Dog Whistle” terms. As so may have been used over the decades by the Cons. But as I learn more and more about the Alt-right, white supremacists and the constant oddly Omni-present place of the Russians, it begins to make sense. One of the most dangerous white supremacists groups calls itself “The Base.” It’s founder and leader is now in Russia. Steve Bannon is touring Europe acting as an Alt-Right ambassador to all of the Nationalist Groups in there. Republicans look to defund the government in any way possible and deconstruct the government, white supremacists are the muscle for intimidating Americans of any color, and corporate groups fund assaults of regulation and justice. Oil supremacists look to make sure our pollution is unhealthily healthy for their profits. And rich ideologues pay for it all, along with a propaganda machine of Biblical proportions. And on that note, we have a religious based system of hate and distrust, fueled every Sunday and Wednesday. This is why we are here at this moment!

Each for their own reasons, areas of importance to them, each seeking to destroy the whole of the nation so that they can pick at the remains without oversight or justice. That is what is happening! To them, and perhaps the think tank or psy-warrior that thought of it, Communism means the common good, as by the Constitution. Socialism means that “All men and women are created equal’ and “Government for and by the people” are socialistic. That only a form of authoritarianism, that gets them what they want is good, at least to them.

This is not only a stealth civil war, but also a replay of WW2. It is fascism and power by the wealthy and white, against an America for a broad based democracy. Except this time a group of Evangelicals are putting their supposed power of God onto the Fascist side. This is exactly what our Fathers and grandfathers fought against.

In the end, communism and socialism is an attack on anything that doesn’t help them and them alone. You can see it in the economic segregation they have imposed, the attacks on everything good for the nation and how they attack without truth, logic and ethics, because it’s all about them. And they feel they have to hide that!

"【What if the LUI Che Woo Prize was awarded 100 years ago?】

In 1898, if the first environmental protection organisation hadn’t been established, the burning of coal in London would have gone unregulated, and people would have experienced untold decades of suffering due to air pollution.

In 1907, if a school in Rome hadn’t revolutionised the method of teaching children, the method of rote learning would have stifled the creativity of some of today’s greatest minds.

In 1956, if a man had given in to terror tactics, and let go of his belief in universal suffrage during grueling years of pressure, criticism and imprisonment, then the world would not have been forced to address racial discrimination, and compassion in society might have been diminished.

These heroes deserve respect and recognition for their courage and dedication to change the world for the better. However, even the greatest heroes can be forgotten with the passing of time.

The LUI Che Woo Prize – Prize for World Civilisation was established in 2015 to commend leaders with outstanding achievements in three objectives: welfare betterment, sustainability and positive energy. International panels select the most honourable nominees in the relevant fields.

If the LUI Che Woo Prize had been established one hundred years ago, which of history’s heroes might have been nominated? In 2020, let’s travel back in time and meet fifteen historical luminaries.

假如他們在歷史缺席，世界不能如此美好。
假如 1898 年，第一個非政府環保組織沒有成立，空氣污染會繼續成為倫敦的城市無形殺手，人類會更遲發現污染影響之大。
假如 1907 年，羅馬沒有出現那所主張啟發兒童自主學習的學校，今天幼兒園的教育方法，可能只流於知識的死記硬背。
假如 1956 年，有人因為囚禁而放棄堅持大同社會的理想，世界的膚色歧視將更嚴重，我們不會深深明暸尊重和平等的意義。

浪花淘盡英雄，但無私奉獻自己的才能、精神和時間的英雄不應被時間淹沒，沒有他們散播希望和改變的種子，地球上不能發展積極正面的文明進步 。

"What scares you? Terrorism? Climate change? Snakes? Germs?

Whether it makes you buy a handgun or hand sanitizer, an electric car or an electric fence, fear drives much of human behavior. And it’s not just fear of physical harm that makes us want to hide under the covers. The twin fears of intimacy and rejection, for example, shape many of our social interactions.

Scientists say fear and its companion — the fight, flight or freeze response — can save us when faced with imminent physical harm.

This served us well when we were cave dwellers, under constant threat from marauding wild animals or invading warrior tribes. But it can often get in our way in modern life.

“Change has occurred so rapidly for our species that now we are equipped with brains that are super sensitive to threat but also super capable of planning, thinking, forecasting and looking ahead,” said Ahmad Hariri, a professor of psychology and neuroscience at Duke University. “So we essentially drive ourselves nuts worrying about things because we have too much time and don’t have many real threats on our survival, so fear gets expressed in these really strange, maladaptive ways.”

Dr. Hariri studies the amygdala, an almond-shaped structure that has been called the seat of fear (there’s one in each hemisphere of the brain). But it’s really the seat of anticipation. The amygdala primes you to react — your pulse quickens, your muscles tense and your pupils dilate — even before other parts of your brain can figure out if you need to be scared or not. We are particularly sensitive to anything new, other people’s fearful facial expressions, or anything that resembles something that harmed us in the past.

Consciously activating the more measured, analytical part of your brain is the key to controlling runaway fear and anxiety.

But it’s not so easy in an era when social media and cable news make us aware of every actual or potential disaster occurring anywhere in the world (and in a repeating loop). It’s even more difficult if you have lots of stress or instability at home or work.

To your primitive mind, it’s as if there are lions and tigers lurking around every corner.

The result is often a juiced-up amygdala more apt to flip you into fight, flight or freeze mode in response to even the slightest concern, and keep you there, rather than return you to a state of calm in the absence of clear and present danger.

Remaining in this state of wary hypervigilance can contribute to issues like social anxiety, hypochondria, post-traumatic stress disorder, insomnia and all manner of phobias. It also plays a role in racial and religious intolerance because fearful people are more inclined to cling to the familiar and denigrate the unfamiliar. According to the National Institute of Mental Health, roughly 18 percent of the United States population is afflicted with persistent, outsized fear responses to seemingly ordinary stimuli.

Arresting an overactive amygdala requires first realizing and then admitting you’re feeling uneasy and scared.

“The more you try to suppress fear, either by ignoring it or doing something else to displace it, the more you will actually experience it,” said Kristy Dalrymple, a clinical assistant professor of psychiatry and human behavior at Alpert Medical School of Brown University.

Dr. Dalrymple is a proponent of acceptance and commitment therapy for managing fear, which has recently been gaining clinical validation. It encourages people not only to accept that they are feeling fearful and examine the causes but also to think about their values and how committing to overcoming their fears would be consistent with who they want to be. The approach forces higher-order thinking, which theoretically disables or diminishes the amygdala response.

Psychologists and neuroscientists are also finding that the amygdala is less apt to freak out if you are reminded that you are loved or could be loved. For example, seeing images of people with frightened expressions is usually a huge trigger for the amygdala, but that response is greatly diminished when subjects are first shown pictures of people being cared for or hugged.

Just as fear can be contagious, so can courage, caring and calm.

Coconut bowls will last a long time if you give them the proper care (no dishwashing, please!) . And when your beloved coconut bowls are no longer up to holding your salads, smoothies, and other goodies on the daily they won't end up as landfill waste. That's right, these handy tools will return right back to nature through composting or recycling.⁣
⁣
Unfortunately, coconut bowls aren't perfect. You should avoid eating hot foods from them and never put them in a dishwasher. They'll require hand washing in lukewarm water with coconut oil polishing every few washes.⁣
⁣
What do you think? Ready to eat all your favorite #healthydishes out of a coconut bowl from now on? Tag someone who runs a restaurant to show them the benefits of coconut bowls.

"When we started our foundation 20 years ago, the world was, in many ways, very different than the one we live in now. It was before 9/11, before the Great Recession, and before the rise of social media.
 
As we were thinking about what our philanthropic priorities would be, we spent a lot of time meeting with experts and studying. What we learned convinced us that the world should be doing more to address the needs of its poorest people. 

At the core of our foundation’s work is the idea that every person deserves the chance to live a healthy and productive life. Twenty years later, despite how much things have changed, that is still our most important driving principle.
 
There is no question that this new decade is beginning at a time of tremendous unrest and uncertainty around the world. But in moments as challenging as this one—as we work to contain the spread of the coronavirus, confront climate change, and address inequality—we remain committed to supporting advocates, researchers, government officials, and frontline workers who are making a healthy and productive life possible for more people in more places.
 
In this year's Annual Letter, Bill and I reflect on the lessons we’ve learned over the last two decades—and look ahead to what's next. We hope you'll take a moment to read it."
"When Yan Wen came back home, she caught her fiancé on bed with Jiang Lingyun, the very woman to whom Yan Wen relinquished the role of the leading actress for the sake of her fiancé, Bai Zhexuan. Instead of exposing their treachery right there and then, Yan Wen chose to walk away and waited by the entrance of the Civil Affairs Bureau the next day as scheduled. Yet, as expected, Bai Zhexuan used a lame excuse and stood her up. It was in that moment she bumped into another man, Jiang Sui-an, a rich CEO who was under family pressure to find a wife. It just so happened that He was also stood up and were trying to find a random woman to marry that day… “President Jiang, if you can’t find a wife, perhaps you could consider me?” “Yes” And just like that, a strange romance unfolded, and with it, Yan Wen also embarked on a journey of punishing that scheming couple… Join us in reading this entertaining and riveting story that is Irresistible Romance!

It was 10 p.m. when Yan Wen drunkenly dragged her tired body back to the apartment. Since she was getting married the next day, she had celebrated the end of singleness with some friends but had a bit too much to drink.
Yan Wen was slumped on the sofa with her eyes closed, when she heard some strange noises coming from the bathroom. It sounded like a couple's heavy breathing. She fumbled over to investigate, leaning on the wall when suddenly a woman's voice rang out, ""Faster… Faster!""
Shameful thumping sounds pierced her eardrums, and then abruptly stopped. Her blood ran cold as the only sound left was the man's heavy breathing.
""Don't wake Yan Wen up. Get dressed and I'll send you home."" The man whispered hoarsely.
""Oh, are you scared she'll find out about us? Don't worry, she drank too much tonight... You might be marrying her tomorrow, but tonight, you're all mine!""
Jiang Lingyun pursed her lips in disapproval and out of the corner of her eye, spotted the indistinct silhouette through the shower door. She smirked and laughed. Yan Wen, isn't it about time you gave up? This way, the child I'm carrying can officially be recognized!
Outside the bathroom, Yan Wen held back her tears and staggered backwards. Leaning on the wall for support, she clenched the fists hanging by her sides as the blood drained from her face.
She had given up a starring role to Jiang Lingyun for this man. She had put all her effort and resources into promoting Jiang Lingyun for this man.
But they... had already been hooking up!
The battle continued in the bathroom for a long time before finally quieting. Yan Wen lay back on the sofa silently, restraining the roiling pain in her heart.
After a while, Jiang Lingyun left the apartment on the elbow of the man.
Hiding behind the curtains, Yan Wen watched as they got in the car together. Her heart felt like it was going to shatter and her eyes swam with tears.
He had promised to go to the Marriage Registration Office with her! What was he going to do about that!
Her heart was filled with desolation and betrayal. Angry and yet still hurting, Yan Wen had a sleepless night. The next day, wanting to know what Bai Zhexuan had to say for himself, she got a car to the Marriage Registration Office as previously agreed.
The appointment time came but Bai Zhexuan did not show up.
Yan Wen waited in the corridor for another hour before she finally received a phone call.
""Wen, Jiang Lingyun injured herself while she was helping you train the rookie. I need to head there now. Regarding the registration, let's do it another day!!""
Huh…… He said it so casually.
Yan Wen clutched at the phone and hung up angrily. When she had discovered the truth last night, she had already decided not to go through with this marriage! Another day? He could keep dreaming!
Since Jiang Lingyun was more important than the countless years they had spent together, she wished this scumbag couple many long years together!
As Yan Wen exited the building, she noticed a fancy car parked nearby. A tall man got off, walking towards her while taking off his sunglasses. In the moment he took them off, the world seemed to lose focus.
He gave off a mysterious yet oppressive feeling, like the aura of an emperor forcing peasants to bow before him.
Yan Wen suddenly remembered that she had seen him before at a brand launch event. He was the president of Dahua Entertainment, Jiang Sui-an.
Two years might have passed since then, but his imposing manner was the same. His tailored suit showed off his excellent figure, and his whole body exuded unattainability.
""Mr. President, I still can't reach Miss Mo… Shall I get someone to pick her up?"" Jiang Sui-an's assistant asked quietly.
""No need. I won't wait for a woman who can't even show up to her wedding on time."" He glowered frostily, voice low.
""But the Chairman insisted that you must marry today, otherwise…"" His assistant's voice became softer as he spoke.
""I'll give you twenty minutes. Find a random woman."" He ordered without hesitation.
Random?
Yan Wen's eye twitched. Jiang Sui-an needed to marry a random woman and she, facing betrayal from her fiancé, also needed a man to attach herself to. That would be a slap in the face for Bai Zhexuan!
She wanted to tell Bai Zhexuan that even without him, she could find a better man. She would make him regret!
Yan Wen made up her mind and quickly stepped up to Jiang Sui-an.
""President Jiang, if you can't find a wife, perhaps you could consider me? My name is Yan Wen.""
Time stilled as Jiang Sui-an raised his eyebrows, looking at the slim figure in front of him.
A woman dared to say that to Jiang Sui-an! Off to the side, his assistant's eyes widened. Was this woman mad?
Yan Wen stood smiling in front of Jiang Sui-an, even though her heart was in her throat. However, once she set her mind on something, she did not waver.
So she straightened her back and forced herself to face the gaze of the man with the imposing aura.
""Yan Wen?""
Jiang Sui-an pressed his thin lips together and ground out her name in his rich voice.
Yan Wen bravely clenched her fists and replied, ""Yes.""
He took measure of the woman in front of him, his cold face not revealing anything. He looked at his assistant, who was out of the corner of his eye and said something out of the ordinary. ""Get me her files!""
Yan Wen bit the side of her lip, hiding her surprise, and waited for his final decision.
Not daring to defy Jiang Sui-an, the assistant hurriedly pulled up all Yan Wen's information and passed it to him.
Several minutes later, he stood in the doorway of the office and told her, ""Yes.""
Yan Wen let out the breath she had been holding. He had agreed!
Marrying Jiang Sui-an was a double blessing. At the least, they were getting each other out of an awkward position. There was no need for so-called love. As for Bai Zhexuan, she would make him understand what regret really meant!
The registration procedure was a breeze and as Yan Wen exited the building again, this time with Jiang Sui-an, she held a marriage certificate in her hands. Who knew getting married was so easy?
The sun was glaring in her eyes, but it could not compare to the aura of the man beside her.
""Um… Mr. Jiang, could I have a few minutes of your time?"" Yan Wen called out, voice laced with nervousness. Even after getting the certificate, she still felt uneasy about his emotional distance. But that could also be a good thing.
The man frowned slightly at the formality, the coldness in his eyes thawing slightly as he threw out a careless ""Yes"".
Yan Wen took a few quick steps forward and followed him into the car.
""What do you have to say?"" He gave her an inscrutable look, leaning elegantly against the seat.
""I know we are legally wed, but about us… I would like not to announce it yet,"" Yan Wen said carefully, as she looked down and rubbed her fingertips together.
""Why?"" He did not reject her outright, but instead asked quietly.
""I have something to settle first. It won't take long!""
Jiang Sui-an smirked at that. His answer sounded dangerous. ""Of course! You have three months. And I'll send someone to pick you up tomorrow.""
""Pick me up?"" Yan Wen looked suprised and confused.
""You're now my wife. Husbands and wives live under the same roof."" He looked pointedly at the marriage certificate in her hand.
Yan Wen thought about it but had no reason to decline, so she nodded. ""I agree.""
Yan Wen got off at the intersection. As she watched the black Bentley drive off, her legs felt like jelly. She had not only managed to marry herself off, and to an important man no less!
She could not calm the turbulence in her heart, but Yan Wen pulled herself together. Feeling better, she called a car and left. There was still so much to do!
Two streets away, Jiang Sui-an casually flipped opened the newspaper with his long fingers. He instructed his assistant, ""You can tell the Old Man that I'm married. Also, find out what happened to Yan Wen recently.""
He remembered that that she was the screen queen two years ago and was called the the Goddess of Beauty in entertainment industry. But she retired behind the scenes at the peak of her career and there were rumors flying around of her relationship with Grand Entertainment's youngest son Bai Zhexuan.
For someone like her to instigate marriage with him, she had to hiding something.
His thin lips smiled as he thought about her appearance.
Yan Wen started packing as soon as she reached home. She was moving out tomorrow.
She knew that she had been too brash yesterday, marrying a stranger while at the Marriage Registration Office!
But she had no regrets; the only people who would regret were that scumbag couple.
""Wen, it's Zhexuan. Are you okay? Open up!"" Bai Zhexuan stood outside the door, yelling frantically.
Yan Wen had secretly changed her apartment pass code. Had she found out about them?
""Why are you here?"" Yan Wen remained calm. It was not time to show her cards yet.
Bai Zhexuan scrutinized her for a good minute. Not finding anything different and thinking she just had a bad night, he explained why he came. ""Since Lingyun is injured, you need to audition for her this evening. Once you reach the hotel, remember to wear a mask and pretend you're sick. It should be easy to pass off as her.""
""Pass off as her?"" Yan Wen squinted at him. ""Aren't the reporters all aware that she's in hospital?""
If Bai Zhexuan wanted her to be a stand-in, he at least needed to consider all possibilities!
""I've arranged everything. Lingyun's manager will work with you on this. After all, it's your fault Lingyun got injured in the first place. You'd be cruel not to help!""
This role must be very important to Jiang Lingyun's career. Otherwise Bai Zhexuan would not have made the trouble to come to her.
His shameless words made Yan Wen really understand how badly she had been deceived. All the times she had rushed around for Jiang Lingyun… That was all she was worth to him.
""Okay, I'll go."" Yan Wen squashed the hate in her heart and nodded.
Since they were so insistent, she would put up a magnificent performance so as not to disappoint them.
""Remember to get there on time, and don't mess up!"" Bai Zhexuan said as he fixed his gaze on her. He did not notice any change in her, and hurriedly left to comfort Jiang Lingyun.
Yan Wen saw him off with calm eyes. She swore in her heart that she would personally make them both pay!
Shutting the door behind her, she sat alone in silence for a long time. Eventually she picked up her phone and informed her manager Xia about the whole incident.
""What? Did he knock his head somewhere? Asking an acclaimed actress like you to pretend to be Jiang Lingyun for an audition? Jiang Lingyun's acting is nowhere near your level. Isn't he afraid they'll see through it?""
She could hear Xia slamming the table in frustration.
""I have agreed to help."" Yan Wen stared at the photo of her and Bai Zhe Xuan that was left on the floor, unnaturally calm.
""You're really going?"" Xia knew Yan Wen's personality. Once she made a decision, no one could stop her.
Yan Wen lightly kicked aside the box by her foot, the mirror reflecting her peaceful countenance.
""Xia, I know you're worried about me, but there are things I must do. Help me contact the media outlets. Tell them I have breaking news for them.""
""I used to stupidly care about my relationship with Bai Zhexuan and stupidly believed everything he said. But it's all clear now. They will pay the price for using me again and again.""
Her words were a relief to Xia, who had been sincerely following Yan Wen and not given up on her, just waiting for her to wake up.
""Don't worry, I'm always on your side!"" Xia paused before asking, ""But just what are you planning?""
""He's asking me to audition for Jiang Lingyun because he's so sure I won't reveal my face. So I'll let everyone know who I am, and also expose the unfair contract that I signed with Grand Entertainment.""
""Understood. Go ahead and I'll support you the whole way.""

"Who loves sea stars? They are fascinating animals once you get to know them.

They are vital for intertidal biodiversity because they eat mussels, making room for other intertidal species to live. and compete.

They eat by extruding their stomachs and digestive juices into their prey, eating them alive. This is particularly effective with mussels, which cannot move but are remarkably hard to pry open. Another cool fact: they can regrow lost limbs.

Unfortunately, sea stars have been hit really hard by sea star wasting disease over the past few years, starting in 2013. It has virtually wiped out some species from places they used to be quite common. Research has found higher water temperatures can increase the incidence and virulence of the disease, meaning global warming is likely making this problem worse.

"Why a Climate Diet Summit?

For the first time, we are experiencing a global pandemic like never before. The world already feels like a chaotic place. But remember that little thing called the climate crisis? Yeah, it’s not going away. One thing this situation is teaching us is that we DO have the power and capability to make drastic and rapid changes to solve global problems.

We can claim our power as individuals and start making a HUGE difference TODAY.

Our food and agriculture system is one of the biggest drivers of the climate emergency, species extinction, environmental degradation, and the spread of disease.

Did you know that diet change is one of the most powerful ways to stop climate change?

We need both institutional and individual change immediately, but too few people and organizations are talking about the power we as individuals have every single day.

Join us today to learn how we can create a JUST food system that will bring us the SUSTAINABLE future we all want.

This is an all-hands-on-deck crisis, and this is a solution that demands immediate attention—we can't have climate justice without food justice."
"Why buy furniture that’s built locally? 
One reason is because it’s “Green” – a more environmentally friendly choice! 
 
100% of Eastwood’s furniture is sourced from woodworking & metal shops within 60 miles of our stores. 
 
Compare that to mass manufacturing where they are shipping heavy furnishings and raw materials across oceans and continents. (Sometimes, even the wood is forested from one continent & shipped to another for manufacturing!)
 
And, picture the amount of packing materials used just to keep all that mass-produced furniture safe in transit to the U.S.!
 
The way we do it, there is much less fuel used. So, the carbon footprint is minuscule.
 
The solid wood we build with is from Ohio and a couple surrounding states.  
 
And, all of the sawmills near us source from sustainable forests that replant more than they harvest. 
 
Even our reclaimed barn wood is sourced from obsolete farming structures in our area. 
  
There’s an organization, Sustainable Furnishing Council, that is working towards an industry that has a minimal impact on our environment to combat climate change.  

Their vision is to have a locally based industry where all furniture is sourced within 300 miles of the consumer.  
 
Eastwood is already there! 💚

"Why It’s Important to Recycle

Recycling is a great way to help the Earth and its environment. 

Think of the 3Rs—Reduce, Reuse and Recycle. By recycling your waste products instead of just throwing them away you are reducing the pressure on the Earth’s finite natural resources and doing your bit to sustain a clean and safe living environment. You are also reducing the amount of energy needed to make raw materials into usable products; thus making a positive impact on climate change. 

You are also encouraging the reuse of perfectly salvageable materials which can be re-manufactured into other products. Finally, by buying and using products made from recycled materials yourself, you are closing the loop. A vigorous market for products incorporating recycled materials will only encourage manufacturers to create more such products for consumers."

"With 2020 in full swing, ECI is kicking off the year with the return of our Good Ground Farmers Market, a bunch of new workshops and events, and ECI's new Zero Waste Initiative!
✨
Our goal with this new initiative is to empower local schools, businesses, restaurants, and households to rethink their trash, guiding community members through the process of eliminating excess food waste, single-use plastics, and packaging. We are already in talks about food and plastic waste with the Hampton Bays School District, discussing sustainable packaging ideas with a local eatery, and making preparations for our Good Ground Farmers Market to become a zero waste market!
✨
Together, let's make the Hampton Bays a Zero Waste Community! Visit the link in bio learn more!"

"Without steps to rein in heat-trapping gas pollution, hot summers in the Northern Hemisphere are likely to become more frequent and extreme, according to a recent study published by Nature Communications. As summer temperatures continue to increase, drought and water scarcity become intensifying concerns. In the Pacific Northwest, decreased precipitation, diminishing snowpack, and extreme heat during late summer months limit water supplies. #Conserving water is crucial to sustaining the health of humans and surrounding ecosystems during these times. #WeNeedWater

"With over 400 ppm (parts per million) of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere it’s only going to get warmer. It was 3 million years ago the last time we had that much CO2 in the air, and sea levels WERE 60 FEET HIGHER!!

The ice will MELT, say goodbye Florida, DC, NYC, London, etc, the question is, we don't know how long it'll take. It’s hard to guess because we’ve unnaturally pumped CO2 into the atmosphere faster than any other time that we’ve been able to study. Triggering an accelerated negative feedback loop would be catastrophic.

I highly recommend watching this two hour NOVA special airing on PBS, called POLAR EXTREMES. The scientists on the frontline go into detail on the most up-to-date findings regarding climate change. You can stream it!

The science is clear, we need to act with utmost urgency to curb climate change to the point that ceasing all Carbon Dioxide emissions TOMORROW, wouldn't be enough. Carbon sequestration (removing CO2 from the atmosphere) MUST be a priority or we lose coastal cities around the world.

"🚯✴️Youth Leaders are heading to the State Capitol in #Colorado to ban single use plastics ✴️🚯
.
.
@environmentcolorado , CoPIRG, @ecocycle_zerowaste are hosting a Youth Lobby Day: Plastic Pollution event at the Capitol on Thursday, March 5th, 2020! Dozens of kids in elementary school to college are engaging with their state lawmakers on reducing plastic pollution, including Dream Tank youth leaders.
.
.
A youth-driven campaign to ban single use plastics came as a result of last year’s Dream Tank: Future Cities Accelerator. .
During our accelerator at the incredible maker space and learning environment of @museumofboulder , each kid was on a team mission for the course of the week that was focused around solving different SDG’s (Sustainable Development Goals) for example, Gender Equality, Poverty, and Climate Change. The teams decided to take action locally, after learning from local organizations Boulder Community Foundation @commfound , EcoCycle and even a visit from the Mayor of Boulder, Suzanne Jones. .
.
The teams arrived to their own conclusion, that plastic is a major contributor in many of the local and global challenges we face today. Young entrepreneurs created a campaign to ban single use plastics. .
.
A group of students from Platt Middle School and Fairview High School worked with State Rep. Jonathan Singer @jonathan_singer to launch a campaign, @plastic.free.co, to build on this in the fall. Now this bill has a very real chance of being passed here in Colorado. Our Dream Tank leaders and other young people will be there to share their stance on the issue.
.
.
We are looking forward to see what campaigns come out of this years accelerators!! Registration is now open www.dreamtank.co/programs .

"Youth Urge Global Leaders in Davos to Make Pledge Towards Addressing Global Goal in 2020
.
Dream Tank leading through youth innovation and entrepreneurship at the 50th Anniversary of the World Economic Forum
.
Dream Tank is bringing to the roundtable a voice that is not typically seen at these types of global meetings -- the voice of youth. Dream Tank has given rise to a movement of young entrepreneurs who are making tangible impact in their community. Now, they are urging global leaders to make a commitment of not only reaching the goals in 2030 - but this year.
Dream Tank is set to recruit 17 companies or individuals to work with youth entrepreneurs who are each solving a different global goal, from climate change to health and wellbeing.
.
.
One company, Ascension VR, founded by Debi Stack, has already made the pledge. In response, youth hosted a hackathon for the organization to come up with new ways to help veterans with PTSD through the use of gaming. This unlikely partnership, is setting a precedent for how companies develop technologies in 2020 and beyond.
